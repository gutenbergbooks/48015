<h2>NOTE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.</h2>


<p><i>The letters relating to Mr. Ruskin's candidature for the Lord Rectorship of</i>
<i>Glasgow University were published when this volume was almost out of the</i>
<i>printer's hands. They have however been included, by Mr. Ruskin's wish, and</i>
<i>will be found at the end of this volume, where a letter to the late Mr. W. H.</i>
<i>Harrison, which has just been brought to my notice, and two very recent letters</i>
<i>on Dramatic Reform, have, at the cost of some delay, been also added.</i>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<i>THE ITALIAN QUESTION.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>June</i> 6, 1859.</h3>


<p>I have been thinking of sending a few lines about what I
have seen of Austrians and Italians; but every time I took my
pen and turned from my own work about clouds and leafage
to think for a few minutes concerning political clouds and
thickets, I sank into a state of amazement which reduced me to
helpless silence. I will try and send you an incoherent line to-day;
for the smallest endeavor at coherence will bring me
into that atmosphere of astonishment again, in which I find no
expression.</p>

<p>You northern Protestant people are always overrating the
value of Protestantism as such. Your poetical clergymen
make sentimental tours in the Vaudois country, as if there
were no worthy people in the Alps but the Vaudois. Did the
enlightened Edinburgh evangelicals never take any interest in
the freedom of the Swiss, nor hear of such people as Winkelried
or Tell? Not but that there is some chance of Tell
disappearing one of these days under acutest historical investigation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>Still, he, or somebody else, verily got Switzerland rid
of much evil, and made it capable of much good; and if you
examine the influence of the battles of Morgarten and Sempach
on European history, you will find they were good and true
pieces of God's work.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Do people suppose they were done by
Protestants? Switzerland owes all that she is&mdash;all that she is
ever likely to be&mdash;to her stout and stern Roman Catholics,
faithful to their faith to this day&mdash;they, and the Tyrolese,
about the truest Roman Catholics in Christendom and certainly
among its worthiest people, though they laid your Zuingli and
a good deal of ranting Protestantism which Zuingli in vain
tried to make either rational or charitable, dead together on the
green meadows of Cappel, and though the Tyrolese marksmen
at this moment are following up their rifle practice to good purpose,
and with good will, with your Vaudois hearts for targets.</p>

<p>The amazement atmosphere keeps floating with its edges
about me, though I write on as fast as I can in hopes of keeping
out of it. You Scotch, and we English!! to keep up the
miserable hypocrisy of calling ourselves Protestants! And
here have been two of the most powerful protests (sealed with
quite as much blood as is usually needed for such documents)
that ever were made against the Papacy&mdash;one in 1848,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>one now&mdash;twenty thousand men or thereabouts lying, at this
time being, in the form of torn flesh and shattered bones,
among the rice marshes of the Novarrese, and not one jot of
our precious Protestant blood gone to the signature. Not so
much as one noble flush of it, that I can see, on our clay cheeks,
besmirched, as they are, with sweat and smoke; but all for
gold, and out of chimneys. Of sweat for bread that perishes
not, or of the old Sinai smoke for honor of God's law, and
revelation thereof&mdash;no drop nor shadow. Not so much as a
coroner's inquest on those dead bodies in the rice fields&mdash;dead
men who must have been murdered by somebody. If a
drunken man falls in a ditch, you will have your Dogberry
and Verges talk over him by way of doing justice; but your
twenty thousand&mdash;not drunken, but honest, respectable, well-meaning,
and serviceable men&mdash;are made rice manure of, and
you think it is all right. We Protestants indeed! The Italians
are Protestants, and in a measure the French&mdash;nay, even the
Austrians (at all events those conical-hatted mountaineers),
according to their understanding of the matter. What we are,
Moloch or Mammon, or the Protestant devil make up of both,
perhaps knows.</p>

<p>Do not think I dislike the Austrians. I have great respect
and affection for them, and I have seen more of them in
familiar intercourse than most Englishmen. One of my best
friends in Venice in the winter of 1849-50 was the Artillery
officer who had directed the fire on the side of Mestre in 1848.
I have never known a nobler person. Brave, kind, and gay&mdash;as
gentle as a lamb, as playful as a kitten&mdash;knightly in courtesy
and in all tones of thought&mdash;ready at any instant to lay
down his life for his country or his Emperor. He was by no
means a rare instance either of gentleness or of virtue among
the men whom the Liberal portion of our English press represent
as only tyrants and barbarians. Radetzky himself was
one of the kindest of men&mdash;his habitual expression was one of
overflowing <i>bonhommie</i>, or of fatherly regard for the welfare
of all around him. All who knew him loved him. In little
things his kindness was almost ludicrous. I saw him at Verona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
run out of his own supper-room and return with a plate of
soup in his hand, the waiters (his youngest aides-de-camp) not
serving his lady guests fast enough to please him; yet they
were nimble enough, as I knew in a race with two of them
among the fire-flies by the Mincio, only the evening before.
For a long time I regarded the Austrians as the only protection
of Italy from utter dissolution (such as that which, I see
to-day, it is reported that the Tuscan army has fallen into, left
for five weeks to itself), and I should have looked upon them
as such still, if the Sardinian Government had not shown itself
fit to take their place. And the moment that any Italian
Government was able to take their place, the Austrians necessarily
became an obstacle to Italian progress, for all their
virtues are incomprehensible to the Italians, and useless to
them. Unselfish individually, the Austrians are nationally
entirely selfish, and in this consists, so far as it is truly alleged
against them, their barbarism. These men of whom I have
been speaking would have given, any of them, life and fortune
unhesitatingly, at their Emperor's bidding, but their magnanimity
was precisely that of the Highlander or the Indian,
incognizant of any principle of action but that of devotion to
his chief or nation. All abstract grounds of conscience, all
universal and human hopes, were inconceivable by them.
Such men are at present capable of no feeling towards Italy
but scorn; their power was like a bituminous cerecloth
wrapping her corpse&mdash;it saved her from the rottenness of
revolution; but it must be unwound, if the time has come
for her resurrection.</p>

<p>I do not know if that time has come, or can come. Italy's
true oppression is all her own. Spain is oppressed by the
Spaniard, not by the Austrian. Greece needs but to be saved
from the Greeks. No French Emperor, however mighty his
arm or sound his faith, can give Italy freedom.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A gift of that which is not to be given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all the associate powers of earth and heaven."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the time is come at least to bid her be free, if she has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
power of freedom. It is not England, certainly, who should
forbid her. I believe that is what it will come to, however&mdash;not
so much because we are afraid of Napoleon, as because we
are jealous of him. But of him and us I have something more
to say than there is time for to-night. These good, stupid,
affectionate, faithful Germans, too (grand fellows under arms;
I never imagined so magnificent a soldiery as 15,000 of them
which I made a shift to see, through sand clouds, march past
the Prince Frederick William<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> on Saturday morning last).
But to hear them fretting and foaming at the French getting
into Milan!&mdash;they having absolutely no other idea on all this
complicated business than that French are fighting Germans!
Wrong or right, why or wherefore, matters not a jot to them.
French are fighting Germans&mdash;somehow, somewhere, for some
reason&mdash;and beer and Vaterland are in peril, and the English
in fault, as we are assuredly, but not on that side, for I believe
it to be quite true which a French friend, high in position, says
in a letter this morning&mdash;"If the English had not sympathized
with the Austrians there would have been no war." By way
of keeping up the character of incoherence to which I have
vowed myself, I may tell you that before that French letter
came, I received another from a very sagacious Scotch friend
(belonging, as I suppose most Scotch people do, to the class of
persons who call themselves "religious"), containing this marvellous
enunciation of moral principle, to be acted upon in
difficult circumstances, "Mind your own business." It is a
serviceable principle enough for men of the world, but a surprising
one in the mouth of a person who professes to be a
Bible obeyer. For, as far as I remember the tone of that
obsolete book, "our own" is precisely the last business which
it ever tells us to mind. It tells us often to mind God's business,
often to mind other people's business; our own, in any
eager or earnest way, not at all. "What thy hand findeth to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>do." Yes; but in God's fields, not ours. One can imagine
the wiser fishermen of the Galilean lake objecting to Peter and
Andrew that they were not minding their business, much more
the commercial friends of Levi speaking with gentle pity of
him about the receipt of Custom. "A bad man of business
always&mdash;see what has come of it&mdash;quite mad at last."</p>

<p>And my astonishing friend went on to say that this was to
be our principle of action "where the path was not quite clear"&mdash;as
if any path ever <i>was</i> clear till you got to the end of it, or
saw it a long way off; as if all human possibility of path was
not among clouds and brambles&mdash;often cold, always thorny&mdash;misty
with roses occasionally, or dim with dew, often also with
shadow of Death&mdash;misty, more particularly in England just
now, with shadow of that commercially and otherwise valuable
smoke before spoken of.</p>

<p>However, if the path is not to be seen, it may be felt, or at
least tumbled off, without any particular difficulty. This latter
course of proceeding is our probablest, of course.&mdash;But I can't
write any more to-night. I am, etc.,</p>

<h3>[From the "Scotsman," July 23, 1859.]<br />

<i>THE ITALIAN QUESTION.</i><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Berlin</span>, <i>June</i> 15.</h3>


<p>You would have had this second letter sooner, had I not
lost myself, after despatching the first, in farther consideration
of the theory of Non-Intervention, or minding one's own business.
What, in logical terms, <i>is</i> the theory? If one sees a
costermonger wringing his donkey's tail, is it proper to "intervene"? and if one sees an Emperor or a System wringing a
nation's neck, is it improper to intervene? Or is the Interven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>tion
allowable only in the case of hides, not of souls? for even
so, I think you might find among modern Italians many quite
as deserving of intervention as the donkey. Or is interference
allowable when one person does one wrong to another person,
but not when two persons do two wrongs to two, or three to
three, or a multitude to a multitude; and is there any algebraic
work on these square and cube roots of morality wherein I
may find how many coadjutors or commissions any given
crooked requires to make it straight? Or is it a geographical
question; and may one advisably interfere at Berwick but not
at Haddington? Or is there any graduated scale of intervention,
practicable according to the longitude? I see my way
less clearly, because the illustrations of the theory of Non-intervention
are as obscure as its statement. The French are
at present happy and prosperous; content with their ruler and
themselves; their trade increasing, and their science and art
advancing; their feelings towards other nations becoming every
day more just. Under which circumstances we English non-interventionalists
consider it our duty to use every means in
our power of making the ruler suspected by the nation, and
the nation unmanageable by the ruler. We call both all manner
of names; exhaust every term of impertinence and every
method of disturbance; and do our best, in indirect and underhand
ways, to bring about revolution, assassination, or any
other close of the existing system likely to be satisfactory to
Royals<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in general. This is your non-intervention when a
nation is prosperous.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Italian nation is unhappy and
unprosperous; its trade annihilated, its arts and sciences retrograde,
its nerve and moral sense prostrated together; it is
capable only of calling to you for help, and you will not help
it. The man you have been calling names, with his unruly
colonels, undertakes to help it, and Christian England, with
secret hope that, in order to satisfy her spite against the unruly
colonels, the French army may be beaten, and the Papacy fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
established over the whole of Italy&mdash;Christian England, I say,
with this spiteful jealousy for one of her motives, and a dim,
stupid, short-sighted, sluggish horror of interruption of business
for the other, takes, declaratively and ostensibly, this
highly Christian position. "Let who will prosper or perish,
die or live&mdash;let what will be declared or believed&mdash;let whatsoever
iniquity be done, whatsoever tyranny be triumphant, how
many soever of faithful or fiery soldiery be laid in new embankments
of dead bodies along those old embankments of Mincio
and Brenta; yet will we English drive our looms, cast up our
accounts, and bet on the Derby, in peace and gladness; our
business is only therewith; for us there is no book of fate, only
ledgers and betting-books; for us there is no call to meddle in
far-away business. See ye to it. We wash our hands of it in
that sea-foam of ours; surely the English Channel is better
than Abana and Pharpar, or than the silver basin which Pilate
made use of, and our soap is of the best almond-cake."</p>

<p>I hear the Derby was great this year.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I wonder, sometimes,
whether anybody has ever calculated, in England, how
much taxation the nation pays annually for the maintenance
of that great national institution. Observe&mdash;what I say of the
spirit in which the English bear themselves at present, is
founded on what I myself have seen and heard, not on what
I read in journals. I read them little at home&mdash;here I hardly
see them. I have no doubt that in the Liberal papers one
might find much mouthing about liberty, as in the Conservative
much about order, it being neither liberty nor order which
is wanted, but Justice. You may have Freedom of all Abomination,
and Order of all Iniquity&mdash;if you look for Forms instead
of Facts. Look for the facts first&mdash;the doing of justice howsoever
and by whatsoever forms or informalities. And the forms
will come&mdash;shapely enough, and sightly enough, afterwards.
Yet, perhaps, not till long afterwards. Earnest as I am for the
freedom of Italy, no one can hope less from it, for many a year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>to come. Even those Vaudois, whom you Presbyterians admire
so much, have made as yet no great show of fruit out of their
religious freedom. I went up from Turin to Torre di Lucerna
to look at them last year. I have seldom slept in a dirtier inn,
seldom seen peasants' cottages so ill built, and never yet in my
life saw anywhere paths so full of nettles. The faces of the
people are interesting, and their voices sweet, except in howlings
on Sunday evening, which they performed to a very disquieting
extent in the street till about half-past ten, waking me
afterwards between twelve and one with another "catch," and
a dance through the village of the liveliest character. Protestantism
is apt sometimes to take a gayer character abroad than
with us. Geneva has an especially disreputable look on Sunday
evenings, and at Hanover I see the shops are as wide open
on Sunday as Saturday; here, however, in Berlin, they shut up
as close as you do at Edinburgh. I think the thing that annoyed
me most at La Tour, however, was the intense sectarianism
of the Protestant dogs. I can make friends generally, fast
enough, with any canine or feline creature; but I could make
nothing of those evangelical brutes, and there was as much
snarling and yelping that afternoon before I got past the farmhouses
to the open hill-side, as in any of your Free Church
discussions. It contrasted very painfully with the behavior of
such Roman Catholic dogs as I happen to know&mdash;St. Bernard's
and others&mdash;who make it their business to entertain strangers.
But the hill-side was worth reaching&mdash;for though that Lucerna
valley is one of the least interesting I ever saw in the Alps,
there is a craggy ridge on the north of it which commands a
notable view. In about an hour and a half's walking you may
get up to the top of a green, saddle-shaped hill, which separates
the Lucerna valley from that of Angrogna; if then, turning to
the left (westward), you take the steepest way you can find up
the hill, another couple of hours will bring you to a cone of
stones which the shepherds have built on the ridge, and there
you may see all the historical sites of the valley of Angrogna
as in a map&mdash;and as much of Monte Viso and Piedmont as
clouds will let you. I wish I could draw you a map of Pied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>mont
as I saw it that afternoon. The air was half full of white
cumulus clouds, lying nearly level about fifteen hundred feet
under the ridge; and through every gap of them a piece of
Piedmont with a city or two. Turin, twenty-eight miles away
as the bird flies, shows through one cloud-opening like a handful
of golden sand in a pool of blue sea.</p>

<p>I've no time to write any more to-day, for I've been to
Charlottenburg, out of love for Queen Louise.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I can't see a
good painting of her anywhere, and they show her tomb by
blue light, like the nun scene in <i>Robert le Diable</i>. A German
woman's face, if beautiful at all, is exquisitely beautiful; but
it depends mainly on the thoughtfulness of the eyes, and the
bright hair. It rarely depends much upon the nose, which
has perhaps a tendency to be&mdash;if anything&mdash;a little too broadish
and flattish&mdash;perhaps one might even say in some cases,
knobbish. (The Hartz mountains, I see, looking at them from
Brunswick, have similar tendencies, less excusably and more
decidedly.) So when the eyes are closed&mdash;and for the soft
hair one has only furrowed marble&mdash;and the nose to its natural
disadvantages adds that of being seen under blue light, the
general effect is disappointing.</p>

<p>Frederick the Great's celebrated statue is at the least ten
yards too high<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> from the ground to be of any use; one sees
nothing but the edges of the cloak he never wore, the soles of
his boots, and, in a redundant manner, his horse's tail. Under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>which vertically is his Apotheosis. In which process he sits
upon the back of an eagle, and waves a palm, with appearance
of satisfaction to himself, and it is to be hoped no danger of
any damage to three stars in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Kiss's Amazon makes a good grotesque for the side of the
Museum steps; it was seen to disadvantage in London. The
interior of the gallery is very beautiful in many ways; and
Holbein's portrait of George Gyzen is worth coming all the
way from England to see only ten minutes. I never saw so
noble a piece of work of its kind in my life.</p>

<h3>[From "The Scotsman," August 6, 1859.]<br />

<i>THE ITALIAN QUESTION.</i><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Schaffhausen</span>, <i>August</i> 1, 1859.</h3>


<p>
<i>Letter to the Editor</i> (<i>of "The Scotsman"</i>).<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have just received the number of the <i>Scotsman</i>
containing my second letter from Berlin, in which there is
rather an awkward misprint of "royals" for "rogues," which
must have puzzled some of your readers, no less than the
general tone of the letter, written as it was for publication at
another time, and as one of a series begun in another journal.
I am obliged by the admission of the letter into your columns;
and I should have been glad to continue in those columns the
series I intended, had not the refusal of this letter by the
<i>Witness</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> shown me the liability to misapprehension under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>which I should be writing. I had thought that, seeing for
these twenty years I have been more or less conversant with
Italy and the Italians, a few familiar letters written to a personal
friend, at such times as I could win from my own work,
might not have been uninteresting to Scottish readers, even
though my opinions might occasionally differ sharply from
theirs, or be expressed in such rough way as strong opinions
must be, when one has no time to polish them into more pleasing
presentability. The refusal of the letter by the <i>Witness</i>
showed me that this was not so; and as I have no leisure to
take up the subject methodically, I must leave what I have
written in its present imperfect form. It is indeed not mainly
a question of time, which I would spend gladly, though to
handle the subject of the present state of Italy with any completeness
would involve a total abandonment of other work for
some weeks. But I feel too deeply in this matter to allow
myself to think of it continuously. To me, the state of the
modern political mind, which hangs the slaughter of twenty
thousand men, and the destinies of twenty myriads of human
souls, on the trick that transforms a Ministry, or the chances
of an enlarged or diminished interest in trade, is something so
horrible that I find no utterance wherewith to characterize it&mdash;nor
any courage wherewith to face the continued thought of
it, unless I had clear expectation of doing good by the effort&mdash;expectation
which the mere existence of the fact forbids. I
leave therefore the words I have written to such work as they
may; hoping, indeed, nothing from any words; thankful, if a
few people here and there understand and sympathize in the
feelings with which they were written; and thankful, if none
so sympathize, that I am able at least to claim some share in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>the sadness, though not in the triumph, of the words of Farinata&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> After a careful and repeated search in the columns of the <i>Witness</i>, I
am still unable to certainly explain these allusions. It seems, however,
that the two preceding letters had been sent to the <i>Witness</i>, which printed
the first and refused to print the second. The <i>Scotsman</i> printed both under
the titles of "Mr. Ruskin on the Italian Question," and "Mr. Ruskin on
Foreign Politics," whilst it distinguished this third letter by the additional
heading of "Letter to the Editor." It may be conjectured, therefore, that
the first two letters were reprinted by the <i>Scotsman</i> from another paper,
and that, in receiving the number of the <i>Scotsman</i> containing the second,
Mr. Ruskin did not know that it had reprinted the first also. As to the
"series begun in another journal," it is, I think, clear that it had not been
long continued, as the letter dated "June 15," sent to and refused by it, is
spoken of as "the second letter," so that that dated "June 6" must have
been the first, as this was unquestionably the last of the series.</p></div>

Farinata degli Uberti was a noble Florentine, and the leader of the
Ghibelline faction, when they obtained a signal victory over the Guelfi at
Montaperto, near the river Arbia. Machiavelli calls him "a man of exalted
soul, and great military talents" (Hist. of Florence, Bk. ii). Subsequently,
when it was proposed that, in order to maintain the ascendency of the
Ghibelline faction in Tuscany, Florence should be destroyed, Farinata
alone of all the Council opposed the measure, declaring that he had endured
every hardship with no other view than that of being able to pass his days
in his own country. (See Cary's notes to Canto x.)</p></div></div>

<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Zurich</span>, <i>Oct. 25th</i>, 1863.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I beg to acknowledge your favor of the 20th of October.
My health does not now admit of my taking part frequently
in public business; yet I should have held it a duty to
accept the invitation of the directors of the Liverpool Institute,
but that, for the time being, my temper is at fault, as well as
my health; and I am wholly unable to go on with any of my
proper work, owing to the horror and shame with which I
regard the political position taken, or rather sunk into, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>England in her foreign relations&mdash;especially in the affairs of
Italy and Poland.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> What these matters have to do with Art
may not at first be clear, but I can perhaps make it so by a short
similitude. Suppose I had been engaged by an English gentleman
to give lectures on Art to his son. Matters at first go
smoothly, and I am diligent in my definitions of line and color,
until, one Sunday morning at breakfast time, a ticket-of-leave
man takes a fancy to murder a girl in the road leading round
the lawn, before the house-windows. My patron, hearing the
screams, puts down his paper, adjusts his spectacles, slowly
apprehends what is going on, and rings the bells for his smallest
footman. "John, take my card and compliments to that gentleman
outside the hedge, and tell him that his proceedings are
abnormal, and, I may add, to me personally&mdash;offensive. Had
that road passed through my property, I should have felt it my
duty to interfere." John takes the card, and returns with it;
the ticket-of-leave man finishes his work at his leisure; but, the
screams ceasing as he fills the girl's mouth with clay, the English
gentleman returns to his muffins, and congratulates himself
on having "kept out of that mess." Presently afterwards
he sends for me to know if I shall be ready to lecture on Monday.
I am somewhat nervous, and answer&mdash;I fear rudely&mdash;"Sir,
your son is a good lad; I hope he will grow to be a man&mdash;but,
for the present, I cannot teach him anything. I should
like, indeed, to teach <i>you</i> something, but have no words for the
lesson." Which indeed I have not. If I say any words on
such matters, people ask me, "Would I have the country go to
war? do I know how dreadful a thing war is?" Yes, truly, I
know it. I like war as ill as most people&mdash;so ill, that I would
not spend twenty millions a year in making machines for it,
neither my holidays and pocket money in playing at it; yet I
would have the country go to war, with haste, in a good quarrel;
and, which is perhaps eccentric in me, rather in another's
quarrel than in her own. We say of ourselves complacently
that we will not go to war for an idea; but the phrase interpreted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>means only, that we will go to war for a bale of goods,
but not for justice nor for mercy; and I would ask you to
favor me so far as to read this letter to the students at your
meeting, and say to them that I heartily wish them well; but
for the present I am too sad to be of any service to them; that
our wars in China and Japan<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> are not likely to furnish good
subjects for historical pictures; that "ideas" happen, unfortunately,
to be, in Art, the principal things; and that a country
which will not fight for its ideas is not likely to have anything
worth painting.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Will you allow me, in fewest words, to say how deeply
I concur in all that is said in that noble letter of Lord Townshend's
published in your columns this morning&mdash;except only
in its last sentence, "It is time to protest."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Alas! if protests
were of any use, men with hearts and lips would have protested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>enough by this time. But they are of none, and can be of
none. What true words are worth any man's utterance, while
it is possible for such debates as last Monday's to be, and two
English gentlemen can stand up before the English Commons
to quote Virgil at each other, and round sentences, and show
their fineness of wrist in their pretty little venomous carte and
tierce of personality, while, even as they speak, the everlasting
silence is wrapping the brave massacred Danes?<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> I do not
know, never shall know, how this is possible. If a cannon shot
carried off their usher's head, nay, carried off but his rod's
head, at their room door, they would not round their sentences,
I fancy, in asking where the shot came from; but because
these infinite masses of advancing slaughter are a few hundred
miles distant from them, they can speak their stage speeches
out in content. Mr. Gladstone must go to places, it seems,
before he can feel! Let him go to Alsen, as he went to
Naples,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and quote Virgil to the Prussian army. The English
mind, judging by your leaders, seems divided between the
German-cannon nuisance and the Savoyard street-organ nuisance;
but was there ever hurdy-gurdy like this dissonance of
eternal talk?<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The Savoyard at least grinds his handle one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>way, but these classical discords on the double pipe, like Mr.
Kinglake's two tunes&mdash;past and present<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;on Savoy and Denmark,
need stricter police interference, it seems to me! The
cession of Savoy was the peaceful present of a few crags, goats,
and goatherds by one king to another; it was also fair pay for
fair work, and, in the profoundest sense, no business of ours.
Whereupon Mr. Kinglake mewed like a moonstruck cat going
to be made a mummy of for Bubastis. But we saw the noble
Circassian nation murdered, and never uttered word for them.
We saw the noble Polish nation sent to pine in ice, and never
struck blow for them. Now the nation of our future Queen
calls to us for help in its last agony, and we round sentences
and turn our backs. Sir, I have no words for these things,
because I have no hope. It is not these squeaking puppets
who play before us whom we have to accuse; it is not by cutting
the strings of them that we can redeem our deadly error.</p>

<p>We English, as a nation, know not, and care not to know,
a single broad or basic principle of human justice. We have
only our instincts to guide us. We will hit anybody again
who hits us. We will take care of our own families and our
own pockets; and we are characterized in our present phase of
enlightenment mainly by rage in speculation, lavish expenditure
on suspicion or panic, generosity whereon generosity is
useless, anxiety for the souls of savages, regardlessness of those
of civilized nations, enthusiasm for liberation of blacks, apathy
to enslavement of whites, proper horror of regicide, polite
respect for populicide, sympathy with those whom we can no
longer serve, and reverence for the dead, whom we have ourselves
delivered to death.</p>

pointed out that a committee appointed in 1862 with the object of aiding
the tribes of the Caucasus against Russia had failed in obtaining subscriptions,
whilst that of 1864, for relieving the sufferers when resistance had
become impossible, was more successful. "The few bestowed their sympathy
upon the struggle for life; the many reserved theirs for the agonies
of death.... To which side, I would ask, do reason and justice
incline?" After commenting on the "tardy consolation for an evil which
we have neglected to avert," and after remarking that "in the national
point of view the case of Poland is an exact counterpart to that of Circassia,"
the letter thus concluded: "Against such a state of things it is surely

<i>THE JAMAICA INSURRECTION.</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Will you allow me, in this informal manner, to express
what I should have wished to express by signature of the
memorial you publish to-day from Huddersfield<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> respecting
the Jamaica insurrection, and to thank you for your excellent
article of the 15th December on the same subject. I am compelled
to make this request, because I see my friend Mr.
Thomas Hughes has been abetting the Radical movement
against Governor Eyre; and as I employed what little influence
I have with the London workmen to aid the return of Mr.
Hughes for Lambeth, I may perhaps be thought to concur
with him in every line of action he may see fit subsequently
to adopt. Permit me, then, once for all, through your widely-read
columns, to say that I did what I could towards the return
both of Mr. J. S. Mill and of Mr. Hughes,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> not because I held
with them in all their opinions, or even in the main principle
of their opinions, but because I knew they had a principle of
opinions; that they were honest, thoughtful, and benevolent
men; and far worthier to be in Parliament (even though it
might be in opposition to many causes I had at heart) than
any other candidates I knew. They are my opponents in
many things, though I thought better of them both than that
they would countenance this fatuous outcry against Governor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Eyre. But in most directions of thought and action they are
for Liberty, and I am for Lordship; they are Mob's men and
I am a King's man. Yes, sir, I am one of those almost forgotten
creatures who shrivel under your daily scorn; I am a
"Conservative," and hope forever to be a Conservative in the
deepest sense&mdash;a Re-former, not a De-former. Not that I like
slavery, or object to the emancipation of any kind or number
of blacks in due place and time. But I understand something
more by "slavery" than either Mr. J. S. Mill or Mr. Hughes;
and believe that white emancipation not only ought to precede,
but must by law of all fate precede, black emancipation. I
much dislike the slavery, to man, of an African laborer, with
a spade on his shoulder; but I more dislike the slavery, to the
devil, of a Calabrian robber with a gun on his shoulder. I dislike
the American serf-economy, which separates, occasionally,
man and wife; but I more dislike the English serf-economy,
which prevents men from being able to have wives at all. I
dislike the slavery which obliges women (if it does) to carry
their children over frozen rivers; but I more dislike the slavery
which makes them throw their children into wells. I would
willingly hinder the selling of girls on the Gold Coast; but
primarily, if I might, would hinder the selling of them in
Mayfair. And, finally, while I regret the need that may exist
among savages in a distant island for their governor to do his
work sharply and suddenly on them, I far more regret the
need among men of race and capacity for the work of governors
when they have no governor to give it them. Of all dishonorable
and impious captivities of this age, the darkest was that
of England to Russia, by which she was compelled to refuse to
give Greece a King when Greece besought one from her, and
to permit that there should be set on the Acropolis throne no
Governor Eyre, nor anything like him, but such a shadow of
King as the black fates cast upon a nation for a curse, saying,
"Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child!"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

The whole weight of my conviction and good wishes is with you."
Mr. Carlyle was, with Sir Roderick Murchison, one of the two vice-presidents
of the Defence Committee. (See "The History of the Jamaica Case,"

<h3>[From "The Daily Telegraph," October 7, 1870.]<br />

<i>THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: My friends ask me why I speak no word about this
war, supposing&mdash;like vain friends as they are&mdash;that I might
have some poor influence of intercession for filigree-work,
French clocks, and other tender articles of vertu, felt at this
moment to be in grave danger.</p>

<p>But, in the first place, I know that the just Fates will
reward no intercession, either for human life or chinaware,
until their will has been accomplished upon all of us. In the
second, I know also that the German armies will spare what
they can, and think they ought, without taking advice of me.
In the third, I have said long ago&mdash;no one listening&mdash;the best
I had to say on these matters.</p>

<p>But, after your notice to-day of the escape of M. Edouard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Fr&egrave;re,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> whose gentle power I was, I believe, the first to recognize
publicly in England, it is possible that some of your
readers may care to look back at what I wrote of modern war
four years ago, and to know the aspect it takes to me, now
that it has come to pass.</p>

<p>If you will reprint these few following sentences for me
from the "Crown of Wild Olive,"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> I shall be able to-morrow
to put what I would add to them briefly enough to claim little
space in your columns:</p>

<p>If you have to take away masses of men from all industrial
employment&mdash;to feed them by the labor of others&mdash;to move
them, and provide them with destructive machines, varied daily
in national rivalship of inventive cost; if you have to ravage
the country which you attack&mdash;to destroy, for a score of future
years, its roads, its woods, its cities, and its harbors; and if,
finally, having brought masses of men, counted by hundreds of
thousands, face to face, you tear those masses to pieces with
jagged shot, and leave fragments of living creatures, countlessly
beyond all help of surgery, to starve and parch, through days of
torture, down into clots of clay&mdash;what book of accounts shall
record the cost of your work&mdash;what book of judgment sentence
the guilt of it?</p>

<p>That, I say, is <i>modern</i> war&mdash;scientific war&mdash;chemical and
mechanical war&mdash;worse even than the savage's poisoned arrow.
And yet you will tell me, perhaps, that any other war than this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>is impossible now. It may be so; the progress of science cannot,
perhaps, be otherwise registered than by new facilities of destruction;
and the brotherly love of our enlarging Christianity be
only proved by multiplication of murder.</p>

<p>But the wonder has always been great to me that heroism has
never been supposed consistent with the practice of supplying
people with food, or clothes, but only with that of quartering
one's self upon them for food, and stripping them of their clothes.
Spoiling of armor is an heroic deed in all ages; but the selling
of clothes, old or new, has never taken any color of magnanimity.
Yet one does not see why feeding the hungry and clothing
the naked should ever become base businesses even when engaged
in on a large scale. If one could contrive to attach the notion
of conquest to <i>them</i> anyhow? so that, supposing there were anywhere
an obstinate race, who refused to be comforted, one might
take some pride in giving them compulsory comfort, and, as it
were, "occupying a country" with one's gifts, instead of one's
armies? If one could only consider it as much a victory to get a
barren field sown as to get an eared field stripped; and contend
who should build villages, instead of who should "carry" them?
Are not all forms of heroism conceivable in doing these serviceable
deeds? You doubt who is strongest? It might be ascertained
by push of spade as well as push of sword. Who is
wisest? There are witty things to be thought of in planning
other business than campaigns. Who is bravest? There are
always the elements to fight with, stronger than men; and nearly
as merciless.</p>

<p>And, then, observe farther, this true power, the power of
saving, depends neither on multitude of men, nor on extent of
territory. We are continually assuming that nations become
strong according to their numbers. They indeed become so, if
those numbers can be made of one mind. But how are you sure
you can stay them in one mind, and keep them from having
north and south minds? Grant them unanimous, how know you
they will be unanimous in right? If they are unanimous in
wrong, the more they are, essentially the weaker they are. Or,
suppose that they can neither be of one mind, nor of two minds,
but can only be of <i>no</i> mind? Suppose they are a mere helpless
mob, tottering into precipitant catastrophe, like a wagon-load of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>stones when the wheel comes off? Dangerous enough for their
neighbors certainly, but not "powerful."</p>

<p>Neither does strength depend on extent of territory, any
more than upon number of population. Take up your masses,
put the cluster of the British Isles beside the mass of South
America, and then consider whether any race of men need consider
how much ground they stand upon. The strength is in
the men, and in their unity and virtue, not in their standing-room.
A little group of wise hearts is better than a wilderness
full of fools; and only that nation gains true territory which
gains itself.</p>

<h3>[From "The Daily Telegraph," October 8, 1870.]<br />

<i>THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: As I am always blamed if I approach my subject on
any but its picturesque side, it is well for me that in to-day's
<i>Times</i> I find it announced that at Strasburg the Picture Gallery&mdash;with
the pictures in it?&mdash;the Library&mdash;with the books
in it?&mdash;and the Theatre, with certainly two hundred persons
in it, have been burnt to the ground under an auxiliary cannonade,
the flames at night being "a tempting target." It is
true that in your columns I find the consolatory news that the
Parisians are repairing those losses by casting a bronze Strasburg;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
but if, as a poor art professor, I may venture an
opinion, I would fain suggest to them that if their own picture
gallery, with the pictures and bits of marble in it&mdash;Venus of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Melos and the like&mdash;and their own Library&mdash;Royal, Imp&eacute;riale,
Nationale, or whatever they now call it&mdash;should presently
become tempting targets also by the light of their own flames,
the casting of a bronze Paris, in even the most imposing of
attitudes, will scarcely redeem their loss, were it but to the
admiring eyes of Paris herself.</p>

<p>There is yet another letter in the <i>Times</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of more importance
than the one from Strasburg. It is headed, "The Difficulties
of Neutrality," dated Bonn, and anticipates part of
what I was going to say; for the rest, the lessons of the war,
as I read them, are briefly these.</p>

<p>As to its cause, neither the French nation nor their Emperor
brought on war by any present will of their own. Neither
of them were capable of a will at all&mdash;far less of executing it.
The nation has since declared, by submission, with acclaim, to
a change of Government which for the time renders all political
treaty with it practically impossible, that during the last
twenty years it has been deceived or subdued into obedience
to a man for whom it had no respect, and who had no hereditary
claim to the throne. What "will" or responsibility of
action can be expected from a nation which confesses this of
itself? On the other hand, the Emperor, be his motives never
so selfish, could only have hoped to save his dynasty by compliance
with the passions of a populace which he knew would
overthrow it in the first hour of their mortification. It is in
these vain passions and the falsehoods on which they have fed
that we must look for the deep roots of all this misery. Since
the days of the First Empire, no cottage in France has been
without its Napoleonic picture and legend, fostering one and
the same faith in the heart of every peasant boy, that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
no glory but in battle; and since the founding of the Second
Empire no street of any city has risen into its foolish magnificence
without collateral proclamation that there was no pleasure
but in vice.</p>

<p>Then, secondly, for the actual question of the war: it is a
simple and testing struggle between pure Republicanism on
the one side, expressed in the most exquisite, finished, and
exemplary anarchy, yet achieved under&mdash;earth&mdash;and one of
the truest Monarchies and schools of honor and obedience yet
organized under heaven. And the secret of its strength, we
have to note, is essentially pacific; for all the wars of the
Great Friedrich would have passed away resultless&mdash;as great
wars usually do&mdash;had it not been for this pregnant fact at
the end of them: "All his artillery horses are parted into
plough-teams, and given to those who otherwise can get none"
(Carlyle, vol. vi., first edition, p. 350)&mdash;that 21st book on the
repair of Prussia being of extant literature the most important
piece for us to read and digest in these days of "raising the
poor without gifts"&mdash;never asking who first let them fall&mdash;and
of turning workmen out of dockyards, without any consciousness
that, of all the stores in the yard, the men were
exactly the most precious. You expressed, Sir, in your article
on the loss of the Captain,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> a feeling common, I suppose, for
once, to all of us, that the principal loss was not the iron of
the ship, but the five hundred men in her. Perhaps, had she
been of gold instead of iron plate, public mourning might
have inclined itself to the side of the metal. But how if the
whole British public should be itself at this instant afloat in a
captain-less Captain, built of somewhat dirty yet substantial
gold, and in extremest peril of turning bottom upwards?
Which will be the end, indeed, unless the said public quickly
perceive that their hope must be, not in docks nor ships, but in
men. They, and they only, are our guarantee for territory.
Prussia herself seems as simple as the rest of us in her talk of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>"guarantees." Alsace and Lorraine, if dishonestly come by,
may be honestly retaken; but if for "guarantee," why these
only? Why not Burgundy and Anjou&mdash;Auvergne and the
Limousin? Let France lose what she may, if she can but find
a Charles and Roland among her children, she will recover her
empire, though she had been beaten back to the Br&ecirc;che; and
if she find them not, Germany has all the guarantee she needs
in her own name, and in her own right hand.</p>

<p>Let her look to it, now, that her fame be not sullied. She
is pressing her victory too far&mdash;dangerously far, as uselessly.
The Nemesis of battle may indeed be near her; greater glory
she cannot win by the taking of Paris, nor the overrunning of
provinces&mdash;she only prolongs suffering, redoubles death, extends
loss, incalculable and irremediable. But let her now give
unconditional armistice, and offer terms that France can accept
with honor, and she will bear such rank among the nations as
never yet shone on Christian history.</p>

<p>For us, we ought to help France now, if we ever did anything,
but of course there remains for us only neutrality&mdash;selling
of coke, and silence (if we have grace enough left to keep
it). I have only broken mine to say that I am ashamed to
speak as being one of a nation regardless of its honor alike in
trade and policy; poor, yet not careful to keep even the treasure
of probity&mdash;and rich, without being able to afford itself
the luxury of courage.</p>

<h3>[From "Fraser's Magazine," July, 1876, pp. 121-123.]<br />

<i>MODERN WARFARE.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "Fraser's Magazine."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The article on modern warfare in your last June
number<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> contains statements of so great importance to public
interest, that I do not hesitate to ask you to spare me space
for a question or two respecting it, which by answering, your
contributor may make the facts he has brought forward more
valuable for practical issues.</p>

<p>The statistics<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> given in the second column of page 695,
on which P. S. C. rests his "incontestable" conclusion that
"battles are less sanguinary than they were," are incomplete
in this vital respect, that they furnish us only with the proportion,
and not with the total number, of combatants slain. A
barricade fight between a mob of rioters a thousand strong, and
a battery of artillery, in which fifty reformers get shot, is not
"less sanguinary" than a street quarrel between three topers,
of whom one gets knocked on the head with a pewter pot:
though no more than the twentieth part of the forces on one
side fall in the first case, and a third of the total forces engaged,
in the second. Nor could it be proved by the exhibition of
these proportions of loss, that the substitution of explosive
shells, as offensive weapons, for pewter pots, rendered wounds
less painful, or war more humane.</p>

<p>Now, the practical difference between ancient and modern
war, as carried on by civilized nations, is, broadly, of this kind.
Formerly, the persons who had quarrelled settled their differences
by the strength of their own arms, at the head of their
retainers, with comparatively inexpensive weapons such as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>could conveniently wield; weapons which they had paid for
out of their own pockets, and with which they struck only the
people they meant to strike: while, nowadays, persons who
quarrel fight at a distance, with mechanical apparatus, for the
manufacture of which they have taxed the public, and which
will kill anybody who happens to be in the way; gathering at
the same time, to put into the way of them, as large a quantity
of senseless and innocent mob as can be beguiled, or compelled,
to the slaughter. So that, in the words of your contributor,
"Modern armies are not now small fractions of the population
whence they are drawn; they represent&mdash;in fact are&mdash;whole
nations in arms." I have only to correct this somewhat vague
and rhetorical statement by pointing out that the persons in
arms, led out for mutual destruction, are by no means "the
whole nation" on either side, but only the individuals of it who
are able-bodied, honest, and brave, selected to be shot, from
among its invalids, rogues, and cowards.</p>

<p>The deficiencies in your contributor's evidence as to the
totality of loss do not, however, invalidate his conclusion that,
out of given numbers engaged, the mitrailleuse kills fewer than
the musket.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It is, nevertheless, a very startling conclusion,
and one not to be accepted without closer examination of the
statistics on which it is based. I will, therefore, tabulate them
in a simpler form, which the eye can catch easily, omitting
only one or two instances which add nothing to the force of
the evidence.</p>

<p>In the six under-named battles of bygone times, there fell,
according to your contributor's estimate, out of the total
combatants&mdash;</p>

  </tr>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></div>
<p>while in the under-named five recent battles the proportion of
loss was&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="under-named five recent battles">
  <tr>
    <td>At K&ouml;niggratz</td>
    <td class="tdr">1/15</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sedan</td>
    <td class="tdr">1/10</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>Now, there is a very important difference in the character of
the battles named in these two lists. Every one of the first
six was decisive, and both sides knew that it must be so when
the engagement began, and did their best to win. But K&ouml;niggratz
was only decisive by sudden and appalling demonstration
of the power of a new weapon. Solferino was only half fought,
and not followed up because the French Emperor had exhausted
his <i>corps d'&eacute;lite</i> at Magenta, and could not (or, at least, so it is
reported) depend on his troops of the line. Worth was an
experiment; Sedan a discouraged ruin; Gravelotte was, I
believe, well contested, but I do not know on what extent of
the line, and we have no real evidence as to the power of
modern mechanics for death, until the proportions are calculated,
not from the numbers engaged, but from those under fire for
equal times. Now, in all the upper list of battles, probably every
man of both armies was under fire, and some of the regiments
under fire for half the day; while in the lower list of battles,
only fragments of the line were hotly engaged, and the dispute
on any point reaching its intensity would be ended in half an
hour.</p>

<p>That the close of contest is so rapid may indeed be one of
the conditions of improvement in our military system alleged
by your correspondent; and the statistics he has brought
forward do indeed clearly prove one of two things&mdash;either that
modern weapons do not kill, or that modern soldiers do not
fight as effectually as in old times. I do not know if this is
thought a desirable change in military circles; but I, as a poor
civilian, beg to express my strong objection to being taxed six
times over what I used to be, either for the equipment of
soldiers who rarely fight, or the manufacture of weapons which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
rarely kill. It may be perfectly true that our last cruise on
the Baltic was "less sanguinary" than that which concluded in
Copenhagen. But we shook hands with the Danes after
fighting them, and the differences between us were ended:
while our expensive contemplation of the defences of Cronstadt
leaves us still in daily dread of an inspection by the Russian of
those of Calcutta.</p>

<p>It is true that the ingenuity of our inventors is far from
being exhausted, and that in a few years more we may be able
to destroy a regiment round a corner and bombard a fleet over
the horizon; but I believe the effective result of these crowning
scientific successes will only be to confirm the at present partial
impression on the minds of military and naval officers, that
their duty is rather to take care of their weapons than to use
them. "England will expect" of her generals and admirals to
maintain a dignified moral position as far as possible out of the
enemy's sight: and in a perfectly scientific era of seamanship
we shall see two adverse fleets affected by a constant law of
mutual repulsion at distances of two or three hundred miles;
while in either squadron, an occasional collision between the
leading ships, or inexplicable foundering of the last improved
ones, will make these prudential man&#339;uvres on the whole as
destructive of the force, and about ten times more costly to the
pocket, of the nation, than the ancient, and, perhaps, more
honorable tactics of poorly-armed pugnacity.</p>

<p>There is, however, one point touched upon in P. S. C.'s
letter, to me the most interesting of all, with respect to which
the data for accurate comparison of our former and present
systems are especially desirable, though it never seems to have
occurred to your correspondent to collect them&mdash;the estimates,
namely, of the relative destruction of civil property.</p>

<p>Of wilful destruction, I most thankfully acknowledge the
cessation in Christian warfare; and in the great change between
the day of the sack of Magdeburg and that of the march into
Paris, recognize a true sign of the approach of the reign of
national peace. But of inevitable destruction&mdash;of loss inflicted
on the peasant by the merely imperative requirements and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
operations of contending armies&mdash;it will materially hasten the
advent of such peace, if we ascertain the increasing pressure
during our nominally mollified and merciful war. The agricultural
losses sustained by France in one year are estimated
by your correspondent at one hundred and seventy millions of
pounds. Let him add to this sum the agricultural loss necessitated
in the same year throughout Germany, through the
withdrawal of capital from productive industry, for the maintenance
of her armies; and of labor from it by their composition;
and, for third item, add the total cost of weapons, horses,
and ammunition on both sides; and let him then inform us
whether the cost, thus summed, of a year's actual war between
two European States, is supposed by military authorities to be
fairly representative of that which the settlement of political dispute
between any two such Powers, with modern instruments of
battle, will on an average, in future, involve. If so, I will only
venture further to suggest that the nations minded thus to try
their quarrel should at least raise the stakes for their match
before they make the ring, instead of drawing bills for them
upon futurity. For that the money-lenders whose pockets are
filled, while everybody else's are emptied, by recent military
finance, should occultly exercise irresistible influence, not only
on the development of our&mdash;according to your contributor&mdash;daily
more harmless armaments, but also on the deliberation
of Cabinets, and passions of the populace, is inevitable under
present circumstances; and the exercise of such influence, however
advantageous to contractors and projectors, can scarcely be
held consistent either with the honor of a Senate or the safety
of a State.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I wish I could get a broad approximate estimate of
the expenditure in money, and loss of men by France and
Prussia in the respective years of Jena and Sedan, and by
France and Austria in the respective years of Arcola and
Solferino.</p>

<i>THE DEPRECIATION OF GOLD.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Times."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Being out of the way of my letters, I did not, till
now, see your excellent article of the 23d September on the
depreciation of gold.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Will you allow me, thus late, a very
few words in confirmation of your statement of the insufficiency
of the evidence hitherto offered on that subject?</p>

<p>The market value of "a pound" depends less on the supply
of gold than on the extravagance or economy of the persons
holding documentary currency (that is to say, claim to goods).
Suppose, for instance, that I hold stock to the value of &pound;500 a
year;&mdash;if I live on a hundred a year, and lay by four hundred,
I (for the time) keep down the prices of all goods to the distributed
amount of &pound;400 a year, or, in other words, neutralize
the effect on the market of 400 pounds in gold imported
annually from Australia. If, instead of laying by this sum in
paper, I choose to throw it into bullion (whether gold-plate or
coin does not matter), I not only keep down the price of
goods, but raise the price of gold as a commodity, and neutralize
800 pounds' worth of imported gold. But if I annually spend
my entire 500 (unproductively) I annually raise the price of
goods by that amount, and neutralize a correspondent diminution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
in the supply of gold. If I spend my 500 productively,
that is to say, so as to produce as much as, or more than I consume,
I either leave the market as I find it, or by the excess of
production increase the value of gold.</p>

<p>Similarly, whatever I lay by will, as it is ultimately spent
by my successors, productively or unproductively, in that
degree (<i>c&#339;teris paribus</i>) increase or lower the value of gold.
These agencies of daily economy have so much more power
over the market than the supply from the mine that no statistics
of which we are yet in possession are (at least in their
existing form) sufficient to prove the dependence of any given
phenomena of the market on the rate of metallic supply. The
destruction of property in the American war and our European
amusements in the manufacture of monster guns and steel
"backings" lower the value of money far more surely and
fatally than an increased supply of bullion, for the latter may
very possibly excite parallel force of productive industry.</p>

<p>But the lowered value of money is often (and this is a
very curious case of economical back current) indicated, not
so much by a rise in the price of goods, as by a fall in that
of labor. The household lives as comfortably as it did on a
hundred a year, but the master has to work half as hard again
to get it. This increase of toil is to an active nation often a
kind of play; men go into it as into a violent game; fathers
of families die quicker, and the gates of orphan asylums are
choked with applicants; distress and crime spread and fester
through a thousand silent channels; but there is no commercial
or elementary convulsion; no chasm opens into the abyss
through the London clay; no gilded victim is asked of the
Guards; the Stock-Exchange falls into no hysterics; and the
old lady of Threadneedle Street does not so much as ask for
"My fan, Peter."</p>

<h3>[From "The Daily Telegraph," October 28, 1864.]<br />

<i>THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In your valuable article of to-day on the strike of the
colliers, while you lay down the true and just law<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> respecting
all such combinations, you take your stand, in the outset, on a
maxim of political economy, which, however trite, stands yet&mdash;if
I am not deceived&mdash;in need of much examination and
qualification. "Labor," you say, like every other vendible
commodity, "depends for its value on the relation of supply
to demand." But, Sir, might it not be asked by any simple
and practical person, who had heard this assertion for the first
time&mdash;as I hope all practical persons will some day hear it for
the last time&mdash;"Yes; but what does demand depend upon, and
what does supply depend upon?" If, for instance, all death-beds
came to resemble that so forcibly depicted in your next
following article, and, in consequence, the demand for gin
were unlimitedly increased towards the close of human life,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
would this demand necessitate, or indicate, a relative increase
in the "value" of gin as a necessary article of national wealth,
and liquid foundation of national prosperity? Or might we
not advisably make some steady and generally understood distinction
between the terms "value" and "price," and determine
at once whether there be, or be not, such a thing as intrinsic
"value" or goodness in some things, and as intrinsic un-value
or badness in other things; and as value extrinsic, or according
to use, in all things? and whether a demand for intrinsically
good things, and a corresponding knowledge of their use, be
not conditions likely, on the whole, to tend towards national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>wealth? and whether a demand for intrinsically bad things,
and relative experience in their use, be not conditions likely
to lead to quite the reverse of national wealth, in exact proportion
to the facility of the supply of the said bad things? I
should be entirely grateful to you, Sir, or to any of your correspondents,
if you or they would answer these short questions
clearly for me.</p>

<h3>[From "The Daily Telegraph," October 31, 1864.]<br />

<i>THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I am grateful to your correspondent "Economist"
for trying his hand on me, and will be a docile pupil; but I
hope his hand is not quite untried hitherto, for it would waste
your space, and my time, and your readers' patience, if he
taught me what I had afterwards to unlearn. But I think
none of these will be wasted if he answers my questions
clearly; there are, I am sure, many innocent persons who, like
myself, will be glad of the information.</p>

<p>1. He tells me, then, in the outset, "The intrinsic value of
commodities is a question outside political economy."</p>

<p>Is that an axiom for all political economists? and may I
put it down for future reference? I particularly wish to be
assured of this.</p>

<p>2. Assuming, for the present, that I may so set it down,
and that exchangeable value is the only subject of politico-economical
inquiry, I proceed to my informant's following
statement:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>"The" (question) "of intrinsic value belongs to the domain
of philosophy, morals, or statecraft. The intrinsic value of
anything depends on its qualities; the exchangeable value depends
on how much there is of it, and how much people want
it."</p>

<p>(This "want" of it never, of course, in anywise depending
on its qualities.)</p>

<p>&#924;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#969;. Accordingly, in that ancient and rashly-speculative
adage, "Venture a sprat to catch a herring," it is only
assumed that people will always want herrings rather than
sprats, and that there will always be fewer of them. No reference
is involved, according to economists, to the relative
sizes of a sprat and herring.</p>

<p>Farther: Were a fashionable doctor to write an essay on
sprats, and increase their display at West-end tables to that
extent that unseasonable sprats became worth a guinea a head,
while herrings remained at the old nursery rate of one and a
half for three-halfpence, would my "recognition" of the value
of sprats in paying a guinea for one enable me to dine off it
better than I should off that mysterious eleven-penny worth of
herring? Or to take a more elevated instance. There is now
on my room wall a water-color drawing, which was once
bought for &pound;30, and for which any dealer would to-morrow
give me &pound;300. The drawing is intrinsically worth about one-tenth
of what it was when bought for &pound;30, the sky having
faded out of it, and many colors having changed elsewhere.
But men's minds have changed like the colors, and Lord A.
or Sir John B. are now ready to give me &pound;300 instead of &pound;30
for it.</p>

<p>Now, I want to know what it matters to "Economist," or
to the Economical Society he (as I understand) represents, or
to the British nation generally, whether Lord A. has the bit of
colored paper and I the &pound;300, or Lord A. the &pound;300 and I the
bit of paper. The pounds are there, and the paper is there:
what does it nationally matter which of us have which?</p>

<p>Farther: What does it nationally matter whether Lord A.
gives me &pound;30 or &pound;300 on the exchange? (Mind, I do not say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
it does not matter&mdash;I only want "Economist" to tell me if it
does, and how it does.) In one case my lord has &pound;270 more
to spend; in the other I have. What does it signify which of
us has?</p>

<p>Farther: To us, the exchangers, of what use is "Economist's"
information that the rate of exchange depends on the
"demand and supply" of colored paper and pounds? No
ghost need come from the grave to tell us that. But if any
economical ghost would tell my lord how to get more pounds,
or me how to get more drawings, it might be to the purpose.</p>

<p>But yet farther, passing from specialties to generals:</p>

<p>Let the entire property of the nation be enumerated in the
several articles of which it consists&mdash;<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, etc.; we will
say only three, for convenience sake. Then all the national
property consists of <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>I ask, first, what <i>a</i> is worth.</p>

<p>"Economist" answers (suppose) 2 <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>I ask, next, what <i>b</i> is worth.</p>

<p>"Economist" answers (suppose) 3 <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>I ask, next, what <i>c</i> is worth.</p>

<p>"Economist" answers&mdash;<i>a</i>/<i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Many thanks. That is certainly Cocker's view of it.</p>

<p>I ask, finally, What is it <i>all</i> worth?</p>

<p>"Economist" answers, 1&#8532; <i>a</i>, or 3&#8531; <i>b</i>, or 10 <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>Thanks again. But now, intrinsic value not being in
"Economist's" domain, but&mdash;if I chance to be a philosopher&mdash;in
mine, I may any day discover any given intrinsic value to
belong to any one of these articles.</p>

<p>Suppose I find, for instance, the value of <i>c</i> to be intrinsically
zero, then the entire national property = 10<i>c</i> = intrinsically
0.</p>

<p>Shall I be justified in this conclusion?</p>

<p>3. In relation to the question of strikes, the difficulty, you
told me yourself, Mr. Editor<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> (and doubtless "Economist"
will tell me also), depends simply on supply and demand: that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>is to say, on an under-supply of wages and an over-supply of
laborers. Profoundest thanks again; but I, poor blundering,
thick-headed collier, feel disposed further to ask, "On what do
this underness and overness of supply depend?" Have they
any remote connection with marriage, or with improvidence,
or with avarice, or with accumulativeness, or any other human
weaknesses out of the ken of political economy? And, whatever
they arise from, how are they to be dealt with? It appears
to me, poor simple collier, that the shortest way of dealing
with this "darned" supply of laborers will be by knocking
some of them down, or otherwise disabling them for the
present. Why is this mode of regulating the supply interdicted
to me? and what have Economists to do with the morality
of any proceeding whatever? and, in the name of economy
generally, what else can I do?<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<h3>[From "The Scotsman," November 10, 1873.]<br />

<i>MR. RUSKIN AND PROFESSOR HODGSON.</i><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE, OXFORD</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;"><i>Nov. 8th</i>, 1873.</span></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Scotsman."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In your impression of the 6th inst. I find a report of
a lecture delivered by Professor Hodgson in the University of
Edinburgh on the subject of "Supply and Demand," in which
the Professor speaks of my "denunciations" of the principles
he had expounded. Permit me, in a matter respecting which
accuracy is of more importance to others than to myself, to
correct the Professor's expression. I have never "denounced"
the principles expounded by the Professor. I have simply
stated that no such principles exist; that no "law of supply
and demand," as expounded by Professor Hodgson and modern
economists, ever did or can exist.</p>

<p>Professor Hodgson, as reported in your columns, states that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"demand regulates supply." He does not appear to entertain
the incomparably more important economical question, "What
regulates demand?" But without pressing upon him that first
question of all, I am content absolutely to contradict and to
challenge him before the University of Edinburgh to maintain
his statement that "demand regulates supply," and together
with it (if he has ventured to advance it) the correlative proposition,
"supply regulates demand."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> Demand does not regulate supply.</p>

<p>For instance&mdash;there is at this moment a larger demand for
champagne wine in England and Scotland than there was ten
years ago; and a much more limited supply of champagne
wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Supply does not regulate demand.</p>

<p>For instance&mdash;I can name many districts in Scotland where
the supply of pure water is larger than in other namable localities,
but where the inhabitants drink less water and more whiskey
than in other namable localities.</p>

<p>I do not therefore denounce the so-called law of supply and
demand, but I absolutely deny the existence of such law; and
I do in the very strongest terms denounce the assertion of the
existence of such a law before the University of Edinburgh as
disgraceful both to its assertor and to the University, unless
immediate steps be taken to define, in scientific terms, the limitations
under which such statement is to be understood.</p>

<h3>[From "The Scotsman," November 18, 1873]<br />

<i>MR. RUSKIN AND PROFESSOR HODGSON.</i><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Oxford</span>, <i>November</i> 15, 1873.</h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Scotsman."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: For Professor Hodgson's "undue encroachments on
your space and his own time," I leave you to answer to your
readers, and the Professor to console his class. To his criticisms
on my language and temper I bow, their defence being
irrelevant to the matter in hand. Of his harmless confusion
of the word "correlative" with the word "consequent" I take
no notice; and his promise of a sifting examination of my
economic teaching I anticipate with grateful awe.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>But there is one sentence in his letter of real significance,
and to that alone I reply. The Professor ventured (he says) to
suggest that possibly I with others "believe that economists
confused existing demand with wise and beneficial demand, and
existing supply with wise and beneficial supply."</p>

<p>I do believe this. I have written all my books on political
economy in such belief. And the entire gist of them is the
assertion that a real law of relation holds between the non-existent
wise demand and the non-existent beneficial supply,
but that no real law of relation holds between the existent
foolish demand and the existent mischievous supply.</p>

<p>That is to say (to follow Professor Hodgson with greater
accuracy into his lunar illustrations), if you ask for the moon,
it does not follow that you will get it; nor is your satisfaction
more secure if you ask for sixpence from a Poor-Law guardian;
but if you limit your demand to an honest penny, and endeavor
to turn it by honest work, the divine law of supply will, in the
plurality of cases, answer that rational and therefore divine
demand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>Now, Professor Hodgson's statement, as reported in your
columns, was that "demand regulates supply." If his assertion,
in his lecture, was the qualified one, or that "wise demand
regulates beneficial supply," your reporter is much to be blamed,
the Professor's class profoundly to be congratulated, and this
correspondence is at an end; while I look forward with deepest
interest to the necessary elucidations by the Professor of the
nature of wisdom and benefit; neither of these ideas having
been yet familiar ones in common economical treatises. But I
wrote under the impression that the Professor dealt hitherto,
as it has been the boast of economists to deal, with things
existent, and not theoretical (and assuredly the practical men
of this country expect their children to be instructed by him in
the laws which govern existing things); and it is therefore
only in the name of your practical readers that I challenged
him, and to-day repeat my challenge, in terms from which I
trust he will not again attempt to escape by circumambient
criticism of my works,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> to define, in scientific terms, the limits
under which his general statement that "supply regulates
demand" is to be understood. That is to say, whether he, as
Professor of Political Economy, is about to explain the relations
(<span class="smcap">A</span>) of rational and satiable demand with beneficial and
benevolently-directly supply; or (<span class="smcap">B</span>) of irrational and insatiable
demand with mischievous and malevolently-directed supply;
or (<span class="smcap">C</span>) of a demand of which he cannot explain the character
with a supply of which he cannot predict the consequence?</p>

<i>STRIKES v. ARBITRATION.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I read your <i>Gazette</i> so attentively that I am always
falling into arrears, and have only to-day arrived at your last
week's articles on strikes, arbitration, etc., which afford me the
greatest satisfaction, but nevertheless embarrass me somewhat.
Will you permit me to ask for a word or two of further elucidation?</p>

<p>I am an entirely selfish person, and having the means of
indulging myself (in moderation), should, I believe, have led a
comfortable life, had it not been for occasional fits and twinges
of conscience, to which I inherit some family predisposition,
and from which I suffer great uneasiness in cloudy weather.
Articles like yours of Wednesday,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> on the proper attention to
one's own interests, are very comforting and helpful to me;
but, as I said, there are yet some points in them I do not understand.</p>

<p>Of course it is right to arrange all one's business with reference
to one's own interest; but what will the practical difference
be ultimately between such arrangement and the old and
simple conscientious one? In those bygone days, I remember,
one endeavored, with such rough estimate as could be quickly
made, to give one's Roland for one's Oliver; if a man did you
a service, you tried in return to do as much for him; if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
broke your head, you broke his, shook hands, and were both
the better for it. Contrariwise, on this modern principle of
self-interest, I understand very well that if a man does me a
service, I am always to do the least I can in return for it; but
I don't see how I am always to get more out of him than he
gets out of me. I dislike any references to abstract justice as
much as you do, but I cannot see my way to keeping this injustice
always in my own favor; and if I cannot, it seems to me
the matter may as well be settled at first, as it must come to be
settled at last, in that disagreeably just way.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, in producing a piece of iron for the market,
one man digs it, another smelts it, another puddles it, and
I sell it. We get so much between us four; and I suppose
your conscientious people would say that the division of the
pay should have some reference to the hardness of the work,
and the time spent in it. It is true that by encouraging the
diggers and puddlers to spend all they get in drink, and by
turning them off as soon as I hear they are laying by money,
it may yet be possible to get them for some time to take less
than I suppose they should have; but I cannot hide from myself
that the men are beginning to understand the game a little
themselves; and if they should, with the help of those confounded&mdash;(I
beg pardon! I forgot that one does not print such
expressions in Pall Mall)&mdash;education-mongers, learn to be men,
and to look after their own business as I do mine, what am I
to do? Even at present I don't feel easy in telling them that
I ought to have more money than they because I know better
how to spend it, for even this involves a distant reference to
notions of propriety and principle which I would gladly avoid.
Will you kindly tell me what is best to be done (or said)?</p>

<h3>[From "The Pall Mall Gazette," April 21, 1865.]<br />

<i>WORK AND WAGES.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I am not usually unready for controversy, but I dislike
it in spring, as I do the east wind (<i>pace</i> Mr. Kingsley),
and I both regret having given occasion to the only dull leader
which has yet<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> appeared in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, and the
necessity I am involved in of dissecting the same, instead of a
violet, on which I was about this morning to begin operations.</p>

<p>But I see, Sir, that you mean fairly, and that you have
careful thinkers and writers on your staff. And I will accept
your battle, if you will fight with short swords, which is clearly
your interest, for such another article would sink the <i>Gazette</i>;
and mine, for I have no time to answer speculations on what
you writers suppose my opinions may be, "if we understand"
them.</p>

<p>You shall understand them utterly, as I already understand
yours. I will not call yours "fallacies" <i>&agrave; priori</i>; you shall
not call mine so. I will not tell you of your "unconscious"
meanings; you shall not tell me of mine.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But I will ask you
the plainest questions, and make to you the plainest answers my
English will admit of, on one point at a time only, expecting
you also to ask or answer as briefly, without divergence or
deprecation. And twenty lines will always contain all I would
say, at any intervals of time you choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>For example: I said I must "dissect" your leader, meaning
that I should have to take a piece of it, as I would of my
flower, and deal with that first; then with its sequences.</p>

<p>I take this sentence then: "He (Mr. R.) seems to think
that apart from the question of the powers of the parties,
there is some such thing as a just rate of wages. He seems to
be under the impression that the wages ought to be proportioned,
not to the supply and demand of labor and capital, but
'to the hardship of the work and the time spent in it.'"</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, I am decisively under that impression&mdash;as decisively
as ever Greek coin was under <i>its</i> impression. You will
beat me out of all shape, if you can beat me out of this. Will
you join issue on it, and are these following statements clear
enough for you, either to accept or deny, in as positive terms?&mdash;</p>

<p>I. A man should in justice be paid for two hours' work
twice as much as for one hour's work, and for <i>n</i> hour's work <i>n</i>
times as much, if the effort be similar and continuous.</p>

<p>II. A man should in justice be paid for difficult or dangerous
work proportionately more than for easy and safe work,
supposing the other conditions of the work similar.</p>

<p>III. (And now look out, for this proposition involves the
ultimate principle of all just wages.) If a man does a given
quantity of work for me, I am bound in justice to do, or procure
to be done, a precisely equal quantity of work for him;
and just trade in labor is the exchange of equivalent quantities
of labor of different kinds.</p>

<p>If you pause at this word "equivalent," you shall have
definition of it in my next letter. I am sure you will in fairness
insert this challenge, whether you accept it or decline.</p>

<h3>[From "The Pall Mall Gazette," April 26, 1865.]<br />

<i>WORK AND WAGES.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I accept your terms, and reply in the fewest words I
can.</p>

<p>I. You "see no injustice in hiring a fly for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the
first hour and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for each succeeding one." Nor I either;
so far from it, that I never give a cabman less than a shilling;
which I doubt not is your practice also, and a very proper one.
The cabmen make no objection, and you could not have given
a neater instance of the proportion of payment to labor which
you deny. You pay in the first hour for the various trouble
involved in taking the man off his stand, and for a proportion
of the time during which he has waited for the chance of your
custom. That paid, you hire him by the formula which I
state, and you deny.</p>

<p>II. "Danger and difficulty have attractions for some men."
They have, and if, under the influence of those attractions,
they choose to make you a present of their labor, for love (in
your own terms,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> "as you give a penny to a beggar"), you may
accept the gift as the beggar does, without question of justice.
But if they do not choose to give it you, they have a right to
higher payment. My guide may perhaps, for love, play at
climbing Mont Blanc with me; if he will not, he has a right
to be paid more than for climbing the Breven.</p>

<p>III. "Mr. Ruskin can define justice, or any other word, as
he chooses."</p>

<p>It is a gracious permission; but suppose justice be something
more than a word! When you derived it <i>jussum</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
(falsely, for it is not derived from <i>jussum</i>, but from the root of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><i>jungo</i>), you forgot, or ignored, that the Saxons had also a word
for it, by which the English workman still pleads for it; that
the Greeks had a word for it, by which Plato and St. Paul
reasoned of it; and that the Powers of Heaven have, presumably,
an idea of it with which it may be well for "our interests"
that your definition, as well as mine, should ultimately correspond,
since their "definitions" are commonly not by a word
but a blow.</p>

<p>But accepting for the nonce your own conception of it as
"the fulfilment of a compulsory agreement" ("the wages"
you say "which you <i>force</i> the men to take, and they can <i>force</i>
you to pay"), allow me to ask your definition of force, or compulsion.
As thus: (<i>Case</i> 1.) I agree with my friend that we
will pay a visit to Mr. A. at two in the morning. My friend
agrees with me that he will hold a pistol to Mr. A.'s head.
Under those circumstances, I agree with Mr. A. that I shall
remove his plate without expression of objection on his part.
Is this agreement, in your sense, "<i>jussum</i>"? (<i>Case</i> 2.) Mr. B.
goes half through the ice into the canal on a frosty morning.
I, on the shore, agree with Mr. B. that I shall have a hundred
pounds for throwing him a rope. Is this agreement validly
"<i>jussum</i>"?</p>

<p>The first of these cases expresses in small compass the
general nature of arrangements under compulsory circumstances
over which one of the parties has entire control. The
second, that of arrangements made under circumstances accidentally
compulsory, when the capital is in one party's hands
exclusively. For you will observe Mr. B. has no right whatever
to the use of my rope: and that capital (though it would
probably have been only the final result of my operations with
respect to Mr. A.) makes me completely master of the situation
with reference to Mr. B.</p>

<h3>[From "The Pall Mall Gazette," May 2, 1865.]<br />

<i>WORK AND WAGES.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have not hastened my reply to your last letter, thinking
that your space at present would be otherwise occupied;
having also my own thoughts busied in various directions, such
as you may fancy; yet busied chiefly in a sad wonder, which
perhaps you would not fancy. I mourn for Mr. Lincoln,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> as man
should mourn the fate of man, when it is sudden and supreme.
I hate regicide as I do populicide&mdash;deeply, if frenzied; more
deeply, if deliberate. But my wonder is in remembering the
tone of the English people and press respecting this man during
his life; and in comparing it with their sayings of him in his
death. They caricatured and reviled him when his cause was
poised in deadly balance&mdash;when their praise would have been
grateful to him, and their help priceless. They now declare
his cause to have been just, when it needs no aid; and his
purposes to have been noble, when all human thoughts of them
have become vanity, and will never so much as mix their
murmurs in his ears with the sentence of the Tribunal which
has summoned him to receive a juster praise and tenderer
blame than ours.</p>

<p>I have twice (I see) used the word "just" inadvertently,
forgetting that it has no meaning, or may mean (you tell me)
quite what we choose; and that so far as it has a meaning,
"the important question is not whether the action is just."
Indeed when I read this curious sentence in your reply on
Tuesday last, "Justice, as we use it, implies merely the conformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of an action to any rules whatever, good or bad," I
had nearly closed the discussion by telling you that there remained
no ground on which we could meet, for the English
workmen, in whose name I wrote to you, asked, not for conformity
with bad rules, but enactment of good ones. But I
will not pounce upon these careless sentences, which you are
forced to write in all haste, and at all disadvantage, while I
have the definitions and results determined through years of
quiet labor, lying ready at my hand. You never meant what
you wrote (when I said I would not tell you of unconscious
meanings, I did not promise not to tell you of unconscious
wants of meanings); but it is for you to tell <i>me</i> what you mean
by a bad rule, and what by a good one. Of the law of the
Eternal Lawgiver, it is dictated that "the commandment is
holy, and just, and good." Not merely that it is a law; but that
it is such and such a law. Are these terms senseless to you?
or do you understand by them only that the observance of that
law is generally conducive to our interests? And if so, what
<i>are</i> our interests? Have we ever an interest in <i>being</i> something,
as well as in getting something; may not even all getting
be at last summed in being? is it not the uttermost of interests
to be just rather than unjust? Let us leave catching at
phrases, and try to look in each other's faces and hearts; so
define our thoughts; then reason from them. [See below.]<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Yet, lest you say I evade you in generalities, here is present
answer point by point.</p>

<p>I. "The fare has nothing to do with the labor in preparing
the fly for being hired."&mdash;Nor, of course, the price of any
article with the labor expended in preparing it for being sold?
This will be a useful note to the next edition of "Ricardo."
[The price depends on the relative forces of the buyer and the
seller. The price asked by the seller no doubt depends on the
labor expended. The price given by the buyer depends on
the degree in which he desires to possess the thing sold, which
has nothing to do with the labor laid out on it.]</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>The answer to your instances<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> is that all just price involves
an allowance for average necessary, not for unnecessary, labor.
The just price of coals at Newcastle does not involve an allowance
for their carriage to Newcastle. But the just price of a
cab at a stand involves an allowance to the cabman for having
stood there. [Why? who is to determine what is necessary?]</p>

<p>II. "This admits the principle of Bargaining." No, Sir;
it only admits the principle of Begging. If you like to ask
your guide to give you his legs for nothing, or your workman
his arms for nothing, or your shopkeeper his goods
for nothing, and they consent, for love, or for play&mdash;you
are doubtless both dignified and fortunate; but there is no
question of trade in the matters; only of Alms. [We mean
by Alms money or goods given merely from motives of benevolence,
and without return. In the case supposed the guide
goes one mile to please himself, and ten more for hire, which
satisfies him. How does he give Alms? He goes for less
money than he otherwise would require, because <i>he</i> likes the
job, not because his employer likes it. The Alms are thus
given by himself to himself.]</p>

<p>III. It is true that "every one can affix to words any
sense he chooses." But if I pay for a yard of broadcloth, and
the shopman cuts me three-quarters, I shall not put up with
my loss more patiently on being informed that Bishop Butler
meant by justice something quite different from what Bentham
meant by it, or that to give for every yard three-quarters, is
the rule of that establishment. [If the word "yard" were as
ambiguous as the word "justice," Mr. Ruskin ought to be
much obliged to the shopman for defining his sense of it,
especially if he gave you full notice before he cut the cloth.]</p>

<p>Further, it is easy to ascertain the uses of words by the best
scholars&mdash;[Nothing is more difficult. To ascertain what Locke
meant by an "idea," or Sir W. Hamilton by the word "inconceivable,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
is no easy task.]&mdash;and well to adopt them, because
they are sure to be founded on the feelings of gentlemen.&mdash;[Different
gentlemen feel and think in very different ways.
Though we differ from Mr. Ruskin, we hope he will not deny
this.] Thus, when Horace couples his <i>tenacem propositi</i> with
<i>justum</i>, he means to assert that the tenacity is only noble
which is justified by uprightness, and shows itself by insuffer-ance
of the <i>jussa</i> "<i>prava jubentium</i>" And although Portia
does indeed accept your definition of justice from the lips of
Shylock, changing the divine, "who sweareth to his own hurt,
and changeth not" into the somewhat less divine "who sweareth
to his neighbor's hurt and changeth not;" and though she
carries out his and your conception of such justice to the uttermost,
the result is not, even in Shylock's view of it, "for the
interest of both parties."</p>

<p>IV. To your two final questions "exhausting" (by no
means, my dear Sir, I assure you) "the points at issue,"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>reply in both cases, "No." And to your plaintive "why
should they do so?" while, observe, I do not admit it to be a
monstrous requirement of men that they should sometimes
sacrifice their own interests, I would for the present merely
answer that I have never found my own interests seriously
compromised by my practice, which is, when I cannot get the
fair price of a thing, not to sell it, and when I cannot give the
fair price of a thing, not to buy it. The other day, a dealer in
want of money offered me a series of Hartz minerals for two-thirds
of their value. I knew their value, but did not care to
spend the entire sum which would have covered it. I therefore
chose forty specimens out of the seventy, and gave the
dealer what he asked for the whole.</p>

<p>In the example you give, it is <i>not</i> the interest of the guide
to take his fifty francs rather than nothing; because all future
travellers, though they could afford the hundred, would then
say, "You went for fifty; we will give you no more." [Does
a man say to a broker, "You sold stock yesterday at 90; I will
pay no more to-day"?] And for me, if I am not able to pay
my hundred francs, I either forego Mont Blanc, or climb
alone; and keep my fifty francs to pay at another time, for a
less service, some man who also would have got nothing otherwise,
and who will be honestly paid by what I give him, for
what I ask of him.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> One of the instances given by the <i>Gazette</i> on this point was that a sovereign

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> The <i>Gazette's</i> criticism on the previous letter had concluded thus:
</p>
<p>
The following questions exhaust the points at issue between Mr. Ruskin
and ourselves:
</p>
<p>
Is every man bound to purchase any service or any goods offered him
at a "just" price, he having the money?
</p>
<p>
If yes, there is an end of private property.
</p>
<p>
If no, the purchaser must be at liberty to refuse to buy if it suits his
interest to do so. Suppose he does refuse, and thereupon the seller offers
to lower his price, it being his interest to do so, is the purchaser at liberty
to accept that offer?
</p>
<p>
If yes, the whole principle of bargaining is admitted, and the "justice"
of the price becomes immaterial.
</p>
<p>
If no, each party of the supposition is compelled by justice to sacrifice
their interest. Why should they do so?
</p>
<p>
The following is an example: The "just" price of a guide up Mont
Blanc is (suppose) 100 francs. I have only 50 francs to spare. May I without
injustice offer the 50 francs to a guide, who would otherwise get
nothing, and may he without injustice accept my offer? If not, I lose my
excursion, and he loses his opportunity of earning 50 francs. Why should
this be?
</p>
<p>
In addition to the above interpolations, the <i>Gazette</i> appended a note to
this letter, in which it declared its definition of justice to be a quotation
from memory of Austin's definition adopted by him from Hobbes, and after
referring Mr. Ruskin to Austin for the <i>moral</i> bearings of the question, concluded
by summing up its views, which it doubted if Mr. Ruskin understood,
and insisting on the definition of "justice" as "conformity with any
rule whatever, good or bad," and on that of <i>good</i> rules as "those which
promote the general happiness of those whom they affect." (See the next
letter.)</p>

<h3>[From "The Pall Mall Gazette," May 9, 1865.]<br />

<i>WORK AND WAGES.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I am under the impression that we are both getting
prosy, or, at all events, that no one will read either my last
letter, or your comments upon it, in the places in which you
have so gracefully introduced them. For which I am sorry,
and you, I imagine, are not.</p>

<p>It is true that differences of feeling may exist among
gentlemen; yet I think that gentlemen of all countries agree
that it is rude to interrupt your opponent while he is speaking;
for a futile answer gains no real force by becoming an interjection;
and a strong one can abide its time. I will therefore
pray you, in future, if you publish my letters at all, to
practice towards them so much of old English manners as
may yet be found lingering round some old English dinner-tables;
where, though we may be compelled by fashion to
turn the room into a greenhouse, and serve everything cold,
the <i>pi&egrave;ces de r&eacute;sistance</i> are still presented whole, and carved
afterwards.</p>

<p>Of course it is open to you to reply that I dislike close
argument. Which little flourish being executed, and if you
are well breathed&mdash;<i>en garde</i>, if you please.</p>

<p>I. Your original position was that wages (or price) bear <i>no</i>
relation to hardship of work. On that I asked you to join
issue. You now admit, though with apparent reluctance, that
"the price asked by the seller, no doubt, depends on the
labor expended."</p>

<p>The price asked by the seller has, I believe, in respectable
commercial houses, and respectable shops, very approximate
relation to the price paid by the buyer. I do not know if you
are in the habit of asking, from your wine-merchant or tailor,
reduction of price on the ground that the sum remitted will
be "alms to themselves;" but, having been myself in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>what
intimate connection with a house of business in the
City,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> not dishonorably accounted of during the last forty
years, I know enough of their correspondents in every
important town in the United Kingdom to be sure that
they will bear me witness that the difference between the
prices asked and the prices taken was always a very "imaginary"
quantity.</p>

<p>But urging this no farther for the present, and marking,
for gained ground, only your admission that "the price asked
depends on the labor expended," will you farther tell me,
whether that dependence is constant, or variable? If constant,
under what law; if variable, within what limits?</p>

<p>II. "The alms are thus given by himself to himself." I
never said they were not. I said it was a question of alms,
not of trade. And if your original leader had only been an
exhortation to English workmen to consider every diminution
of their pay, in the picturesque though perhaps somewhat
dim, religious light of alms paid by themselves to themselves, I
never should have troubled you with a letter on the subject. For,
singular enough, Sir, this is not one of the passages of your letters,
however apparently indefensible, which I care to attack.</p>

<p>So far from it, in my own serious writings I have always
maintained that the best work is done, and can only be done,
for love.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But the point at issue between us is not whether
there <i>should</i> be charity, but whether there <i>can</i> be trade; not
whether men may give away their labor, but whether, if they
do not choose to do so, there is such a thing as a price for it.
And my statement, as opposed to yours, is briefly this&mdash;that
for all labor, there is, under given circumstances, a just price
approximately determinable; that every conscious deflection
from this price towards zero is either gift on the part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>laborer, or theft on the part of the employer; and that all
payment in conscious excess of this price is either theft on
the part of the laborer, or gift on that of the employer.</p>

<p>III. If you wish to substitute the word "moral" for
"just" in the above statement, I am prepared to allow the
substitution; only, as you, not I, introduced this new word, I
must pray for your definition of it first, whether remembered
from Mr. Hobbes, or original.</p>

<p>IV. I am sorry you doubt my understanding your views;
but, in that case, it may be well to ask for a word or two of
farther elucidation.</p>

<p>"Justice," you say, is "conformity with any rule whatever,
good or bad." And "good rules are rules which promote the
general happiness of those whom they affect." And bad rules
are (therefore) rules which promote the general misery of
those whom they affect? Justice, therefore, may as often as
not promote the general misery of those who practice it? Do
you intend this?<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Again: "Good rules are rules which promote the general
happiness of those whom they affect." But "the greatest
happiness of the greatest number is best secured by laying down
no rule at all" (as to the price of "labor").</p>

<p>Do you propose this as a sequitur? For if not, it is merely
a <i>petitio principii</i>, and a somewhat wide one. Before, therefore,
we branch into poetical questions concerning happiness,
we will, with your permission, and according to my original
stipulation, that we should dispute only of one point at a time,
determine the matters already at issue. To which end, also, I
leave without reply some parts of your last letter; not without
a little strain on the &#949;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#962; &#8000;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;, for which I think, Sir,
you may give me openly, credit, if not tacitly, thanks.</p>

<h3>[From "The Pall Mall Gazette," May 22, 1865.]<br />

<i>WORK AND WAGES.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have long delayed my reply to your notes on my
last letter; partly being otherwise busy&mdash;partly in a pause of
surprise and doubt how low in the elements of ethics we were
to descend.</p>

<p>Let me, however, first assure you that I heartily concur in
your opening remarks, and shall be glad to spare useless and
avoid discourteous words. When you said, in your first reply
to me, that my letter embodied fallacies which appeared to you
pernicious in the highest degree, <i>I</i> also "could not consider
this sort of language well judged." When you called one of
your own questions an answer, and declared it to be "simple
and perfectly conclusive," I thought the flourish might have
been spared; and for having accused you of writing carelessly,
I must hope your pardon; for the discourtesy, in my mind,
would have been in imagining you to be writing with care.</p>

<p>For instance, I should hold it discourteous to suppose you
unaware of the ordinary distinction between law and equity:
yet no consciousness of such a distinction appears in your
articles. I should hold it discourteous to doubt your acquaintance
with the elementary principles laid down by the great
jurists of all nations respecting Divine and Human law; yet
such a doubt forces itself on me if I consider your replies as
deliberate. And I should decline to continue the discussion
with an opponent who could conceive of justice as (under any
circumstances) "an hideously bad thing," if I did not suppose
him to have mistaken the hideousness of justice, in certain
phases, to certain persons, for its ultimate nature and power.</p>

<p>There may be question respecting these inaccuracies of
thought; there can be none respecting the carelessness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
expression which causes the phrases "are" and "ought to be"
to alternate in your articles as if they were alike in meaning.</p>

<p>I have permitted this, that I might see the course of your
argument in your own terms, but it is now needful that the
confusion should cease. That wages <i>are</i> determined by supply
and demand is no proof that under any circumstances they
must be&mdash;still less that under all circumstances they ought to
be. Permit me, therefore, to know the sense in which you
use the word "ought" in your paragraph lettered <i>b</i>, page 832<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
(second column), and to ask whether the words "due," "duty,"
"devoir," and other such, connected in idea with the first and
third of the "pr&aelig;cepta juris" of Justinian, quoted by Blackstone
as a summary of the whole doctrine of law (<i>honeste</i>
<i>vivere,&mdash;alterum non l&aelig;dere,&mdash;suumque cuique tribuere</i>), are
without meaning to you except as conditions of agreement?<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Whether, in fact, there be, in your view, any <i>honos</i>, absolutely;
or whether we are to launch out into an historical investigation
of the several kinds of happiness enjoyed in lives of rapine, of
selfish trade, and of unselfish citizenship, and to decide only
upon evidence whether we will live as pirates, as pedlers, or as
gentlemen? If so, while I shall be glad to see you undertake,
independently, so interesting an inquiry, I must reserve my
comments on it until its close.</p>

<p>But if you admit an absolute idea of a "devoir" of one
man to another, and of every honorable man to himself, tell
me why you dissent from my statement of the terms of that
debt in the opening of this discussion. Observe, I asked for
no evangelical virtue of returning good for evil: I asked only
for the Sinaitic equity of return in good for good, as for Sinaitic
equity of return in evil for evil. "Eye for eye," "tooth for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>tooth"&mdash;be it so; but will you thus pray according to the <i>lex</i>
<i>talionis</i> and not according to the <i>lex grati&aelig;</i>? Your debt is on
both sides. Does a man take of your life, you take also of his.
Shall he give you of his life, and will you not give him also of
yours? If this be not your law of duty to him, tell me what
other there is, or if you verily believe there is none.</p>

<p>But you ask of such repayment, "Who shall determine
how much?"<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> I took no notice of the question, irrelevant
when you asked it; but in its broad bearing it is the one
imperative question of national economy. Of old, as at bridge-foot
of Florence, men regulated their revenge by the law of
demand and supply, and asked in measureless anger, "Who
shall determine how much?" with economy of blood, such as
we know. That "much" is now, with some approximate
equity, determined at the judgment-seat, but for the other
debt, the debt of love, we have no law but that of the wolf, and
the locust, and the "fishes of the sea, which have no ruler over
them." The workmen of England&mdash;of the world, ask for the
return&mdash;as of wrath, so of reward by law; and for blood resolutely
spent, as for that recklessly shed; for life devoted
through its duration, as for that untimely cast away; they
require from you to determine, in judgment, the equities of
"Human Retribution."</p>

<i>THE STANDARD OF WAGES.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In the course of your yesterday's article on strikes<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
you have very neatly and tersely expressed the primal fallacy
of modern political economy&mdash;to wit, that the value of any
piece of labor cannot be defined; and that "all that can be
ascertained is simply whether any man can be got to do it for
a certain sum."</p>

<p>Now, Sir, the "value" of any piece of labor (<i>I</i> should have
written "price," not "value," but it is no matter)&mdash;that is to
say, the quantity of food and air which will enable a man to
perform it without eventually losing any of his flesh or nervous
energy, is as absolutely fixed a quantity as the weight of powder
necessary to carry a given ball a given distance. And within
limits varying by exceedingly minor and unimportant circumstances,
it is an ascertainable quantity. I told the public this
five years ago, and&mdash;under pardon of your politico-economical
contributor, it is not a sentimental, but a chemical, fact. Let
any half-dozen London physicians of recognized standing state
in precise terms the quantity and kind of food, and space of
lodging, they consider approximately necessary for the healthy
life of a laborer in any given manufacture, and the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
hours he may, without shortening his life, work at such business
daily, if in such manner he be sustained. Let all masters
be bound to give their men a choice between an order for that
quantity of food and space of lodging, or the market wages for
that specified number of hours of work. Proper laws for the
maintenance of families would require further concession; but
in the outset, let but this law of wages be established, and if
then we have more strikes, you may denounce them without
one word of remonstrance either from sense or sensibility.</p>

<i>HOW THE RICH SPEND THEIR MONEY.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Here among the hills, I read little, and withstand,
sometimes for a fortnight together, even the attractions of my
<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>. A friend, however, sent me, two days
ago, your article signed W. R. G. on spending of money
(January 13),<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> which, as I happened to have over-eaten myself
the day before, and taken perhaps a glass too much besides of
quite priceless port (Quarles Harris, twenty years in bottle),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>would have been a great comfort to my mind, showing me that
if I had done some harm to myself, I had at least conferred
benefit upon the poor by these excesses, had I not been left in
some painful doubt, even at the end of W. R. G.'s most intelligent
illustrations, whether I ought not to have exerted myself
further in the cause of humanity, and by the use of some
cathartic process, such as appears to have been without inconvenience
practised by the ancients, enabled myself to eat two
dinners instead of one. But I write to you to-day, because if
I were a poor man, instead of a (moderately) rich one, I am
nearly certain that W. R. G.'s paper would suggest to me a
question, which I am sure he will kindly answer in your
columns, namely, "These means of living, which this generous
and useful gentleman is so fortunately disposed to bestow on
me&mdash;where does he get them himself?"</p>

1872, and especially with the following sentences in it: "When did
wealth rear such enchanted palaces of luxury as it is rearing in England at
the present day? Well do I remember one of those palaces, the most conspicuous
object for miles round. Its lord was, I dare say, consuming the
income of some hundreds of the poor laboring families around him. The
thought that you are spending on yourself annually the income of six hundred
laboring families seems to me as much as a man with a heart and a
brain can bear." W. R. G.'s letter argued that this "heartless expenditure
all goes into the pockets" of the poor families, who are thus benefited by
the selfish luxuries of the lord in his palace.</p></div></div>

<i>HOW THE RICH SPEND THEIR MONEY.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I am disappointed of my <i>Gazette</i> to-day, and shall be
grievously busy to morrow. I think it better, therefore, to
follow up my own letter, if you will permit me, with a simple
and brief statement of the facts, than to wait till I see your
correspondent W. R. G.'s reply, if he has vouchsafed me one.</p>

<p>These are the facts. The laborious poor produce "the
means of life" by their labor. Rich persons possess themselves
by various expedients of a right to dispense these "means of
life," and keeping as much means as they want of it for themselves,
and rather more, dispense the rest, usually only in return
for more labor from the poor, expended in producing various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
delights for the rich dispenser. The idea is now gradually
entering poor men's minds, that they may as well keep in their
own hands the right of distributing "the means of life" they
produce; and employ themselves, so far as they need extra
occupation, for their own entertainment or benefit, rather than
that of other people. There is something to be said, nevertheless,
in favor of the present arrangement, but it cannot be

<i>HOW THE RICH SPEND THEIR MONEY.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have my <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> of the 28th to-day, and
must at once, with your permission, solemnly deny the insidiosity
of my question, "Where does the rich man get his means
of living?" I don't myself see how a more straightforward
question could be put! So straightforward indeed that I
particularly dislike making a martyr of myself in answering
it, as I must this blessed day&mdash;a martyr, at least, in the way
of witness; for if we rich people don't begin to speak honestly
with our tongues, we shall, some day soon, lose them and our
heads together, having for some time back, most of us, made
false use of the one and none of the other. Well, for the
point in question then, as to means of living: the most exemplary
manner of answer is simply to state how I got my
own, or rather how my father got them for me. He and his
partners entered into what your correspondent mellifluously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
styles "a mutually beneficent partnership,"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> with certain
laborers in Spain. These laborers produced from the earth
annually a certain number of bottles of wine. These productions
were sold by my father and his partners, who kept nine-tenths,
or thereabouts, of the price themselves, and gave
one-tenth, or thereabouts, to the laborers. In which state of
mutual beneficence my father and his partners naturally became
rich, and the laborers as naturally remained poor. Then my
good father gave all his money to me (who never did a stroke
of work in my life worth my salt, not to mention my dinner),
and so far from finding his money "grow" in my hands, I
never try to buy anything with it; but people tell me "money
isn't what it was in your father's time, everything is so much
dearer." I should be heartily glad to learn from your correspondent
as much pecuniary botany as will enable me to set
my money a-growing; and in the mean time, as I have thus
given a quite indubitable instance of my notions of the way
money is made, will he be so kind as to give us, not an heraldic
example in the dark ages (though I suspect I know more of the
pedigree of money, if he comes to that, than he does),<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but a
living example of a rich gentleman who <i>has</i> made his money
by saving an <i>equal</i> portion of profit in some mutually beneficent
partnership with his laborers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Some Sheffield friend has sent me your fourth number,
in the general teaching of which I am thankful to be able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>to concur without qualification: but let me earnestly beg of
you not to confuse the discussion of the principles of Property
in Earth, Air, or Water, with the discussion of principles of
Property in general.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The things which, being our neighbor's,
the Mosaic Law commands us not to covet, are by the most
solemn Natural Laws indeed our neighbor's "property," and
any attempts to communize these have always ended, and will
always end, in ruin and shame.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to learn from America. An Englishman
has brains enough to discover for himself what is good for
England; and should learn, when he is to be taught anything,
from his Fathers, not from his children.</p>

<p>I observe in the first column of your 15th page the assertion
by your correspondent of his definition of money as if
different from mine. He only weakens my definition with a
"certificate of credit "instead of a "promise to pay." What
is the use of giving a man "credit"&mdash;if you don't engage
to pay him?</p>

<p>But I observe that nearly all my readers stop at this more
or less metaphysical definition, which I give in "Unto this
Last," instead of going on to the practical statement of immediate
need made in "Munera Pulveris."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The promise to find Labor is one which meets general
demand; but the promise to find Bread is the answer needed
to immediate demand; and the only sound bases of National
Currency are shown both in "Munera Pulveris," and "Fors
Clavigera," to be bread, fuel, and clothing material, of certified
quality.</p>

<h3>[From "The Daily Telegraph," July 31, 1868.]<br />

<i>IS ENGLAND BIG ENOUGH?</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: You terminate to-day a discussion which seems to
have been greatly interesting to your readers, by telling them
the "broad fact, that England is no longer big enough for her
inhabitants."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Might you not, in the leisure of the recess, open with
advantage a discussion likely to be no less interesting, and
much more useful&mdash;namely, how big England may be made
for economical inhabitants, and how little she may be made
for wasteful ones? Might you not invite letters on this quite
radical and essential question&mdash;how money is truly made,
and how it is truly lost, not by one person or another, but by
the whole nation?</p>

<p>For, practically, people's eyes are so intensely fixed on the
immediate operation of money as it changes hands, that they
hardly ever reflect on its first origin or final disappearance.
They are always considering how to get it from somebody
else, but never how to get it where that somebody else got it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>Also, they very naturally mourn over their loss of it to other
people, without reflecting that, if not lost altogether, it may
still be of some reflective advantage to them. Whereas, the
real national question is not who is losing or gaining money,
but who is making and who destroying it. I do not of course
mean making money, in the sense of printing notes or finding
gold. True money cannot be so made. When an island is
too small for its inhabitants, it would not help them to one
ounce of bread more to have the entire island turned into one
nugget, or to find bank notes growing by its rivulets instead
of fern leaves. Neither, by destroying money, do I mean
burning notes, or throwing gold away. If I burn a five-pound
note, or throw five sovereigns into the sea, I hurt no
one but myself; nay, I benefit others, for everybody with a
pound in his pocket is richer by the withdrawal of my competition
in the market. But what I want you to make your
readers discover is how the <i>true</i> money is made that will get
them houses and dinners; and on the other hand how money
is truly lost, or so diminished in value that all they can get in
a year will not buy them comfortable houses, nor satisfactory
dinners.</p>

<p>Surely this is a question which people would like to have
clearly answered for them, and it might lead to some important
results if the answer were acted upon. The riband-makers
at Coventry, starving, invite the ladies of England to
wear ribands. The compassionate ladies of England invest
themselves in rainbows, and admiring economists declare the
nation to be benefited. No one asks where the ladies got
the money to spend in rainbows (which is the first question in
the business), nor whether the money once so spent will ever
return again, or has really faded with the faded ribands and
disappeared forever. Again, honest people every day lose
quantities of money to dishonest people. But that is merely
a change of hands much to be regretted; but the money is
not therefore itself lost; the dishonest people must spend it at
last somehow. A youth at college loses his year's income to a
Jew. But the Jew must spend it instead of him. Miser or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
not, the day must come when his hands relax. A railroad
shareholder loses his money to a director; but the director
must some day spend it instead of him. That is not&mdash;at least
in the first fact of it&mdash;<i>national</i> loss. But what the public
need to know is, how a final and perfect <i>loss</i> of money takes
place, so that the whole nation, instead of being rich, shall be
getting gradually poor. And then, indeed, if one man in
spending his money destroys it, and another in spending it
makes more of it, it becomes a grave question in whose hands
it is, and whether honest or dishonest people are likely to
spend it to the best purpose. Will you permit me, Sir, to lay
this not unprofitable subject of inquiry before your readers,
while, to the very best purpose, they are investing a little
money in sea air?</p>

<i>THE OWNERSHIP OF RAILWAYS.</i><a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The ingenious British public seems to be discovering,
to its cost, that the beautiful law of supply and demand does
not apply in a pleasant manner to railroad transit. But if
they are prepared to submit patiently to the "natural" laws of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
political economy, what right have they to complain? The
railroad belongs to the shareholders; and has not everybody a
right to ask the highest price he can get for his wares? The
public have a perfect right to walk, or to make other opposition
railroads for themselves, if they please, but not to abuse
the shareholders for asking as much as they think they can
get.</p>

<p>Will you allow me to put the <i>real</i> rights of the matter before
them in a few words?</p>

<p>Neither the roads nor the railroads of any nation should
belong to any private persons. All means of public transit
should be provided at public expense, by public determination
where such means are needed, and the public should be its
own "shareholder."</p>

<p>Neither road, nor railroad, nor canal should ever pay dividends
to anybody. They should pay their working expenses,
and no more. All dividends are simply a tax on the traveller
and the goods, levied by the person to whom the road or canal
belongs, for the right of passing over his property. And this
right should at once be purchased by the nation, and the
original cost of the roadway&mdash;be it of gravel, iron, or adamant&mdash;at
once defrayed by the nation, and then the whole work of
the carriage of persons or goods done for ascertained prices,
by salaried officers, as the carriage of letters is done now.</p>

<p>I believe, if the votes of the proprietors of all the railroads
in the kingdom were taken <i>en masse</i>, it would be found that
the majority would gladly receive back their original capital,
and cede their right of "revising" prices of railway tickets.
And if railway property <i>is</i> a good and wise investment of
capital, the public need not shrink from taking the whole off
their hands. Let the public take it. (I, for one, who never
held a rag of railroad scrip in my life, nor ever willingly travelled
behind an engine where a horse could pull me, will most
gladly subscribe my proper share for such purchase according
to my income.) Then let them examine what lines pay their
working expenses and what lines do not, and boldly leave the
un-paying embankments to be white over with sheep, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Roman camps, take up the working lines on sound principles,
pay their drivers and pointsmen well, keep their carriages
clean and in good repair, and make it as wonderful a thing for
a train, as for an old mail-coach, to be behind its time; and the
sagacious British public will very soon find its pocket heavier,
its heart lighter, and its "passages" pleasanter, than any of the
three have been, for many a day.</p>

<h3>[From "The Daily Telegraph," August 10, 1868.]<br />

<i>RAILWAY ECONOMY.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I had not intended again to trespass on your space
until I could obtain a general idea of the views of your correspondents
on the questions you permitted me to lay before
them in my letters of the 31st July and 5th inst.; but I must
ask you to allow me to correct an impression likely to be
created by your reference to that second letter in your interesting
article on the Great Eastern Railway, and to reply
briefly to the question of your correspondent "S." on the same
subject.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>You say that I mistook the charge against the railway companies
in taunting my unfortunate neighbors at Sydenham<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
with their complaints against the operation of the law of supply
and demand, and that it was because the companies neglected
that law that they suffered.</p>

<p>But, Sir, the law of supply and demand, as believed in by
the British public under the guidance of their economists, is a
natural law regulating prices, which it is not at all in their
option to "neglect." And it is precisely because I have always
declared that there is no such natural law, but that prices can
be, and ought to be, regulated by laws of expediency and justice,
that political economists have thought I did not understand
their science, and you now say I laugh at it. No, Sir,
I laughed only at what was clearly no science, but vain endeavor
to allege as irresistible natural law, what is indeed a
too easily resisted prudential law, rewarding and chastising us
according to our obedience. So far from despising true political
economy, based on such prudential law, I have for years
been chiefly occupied in defending its conclusions, having
given this definition of it in 1862. "Political Economy is
neither an art nor a science; but a system of conduct and
legislature founded on the sciences, including the arts, and
impossible except under certain conditions of moral culture."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>And, Sir, nothing could better show the evil of competition
as opposed to the equitable regulation of prices than the
instance to which you refer your correspondent "Fair Play"&mdash;the
agitation in Brighton for a second railway. True prudential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>law would make one railway serve it thoroughly, and
fix the fares necessary to pay for thorough service. Competition
will make two railways (sinking twice the capital really
required); then, if the two companies combine, they can
oppress the public as effectively as one could; if they do not,
they will keep the said public in dirty carriages and in danger
of its life, by lowering the working expenses to a minimum in
their antagonism.</p>

<p>Next, to the question of your correspondent "S.," "what I
expect the capitalist to do with his money," so far as it is asked
in good faith I gladly reply, that no one's "expectations" are
in this matter of the slightest consequence; but that the moral
laws which properly regulate the disposition of revenue, and
the physical laws which determine returns proportioned to the
wisdom of its employment, are of the greatest consequence;
and these may be briefly stated as follows:</p>

<p>1. All capital is justly and rationally invested which supports
productive labor (that is to say, labor directly producing
or distributing good food, clothes, lodging, or fuel); so long as
it renders to the possessor of the capital, and to those whom he
employs, only such gain as shall justly remunerate the superintendence
and labor given to the business, and maintain both
master and operative happily in the positions of life involved
by their several functions. And it is highly advantageous for
the nation that wise superintendence and honest labor should
both be highly rewarded. But all rates of interest or modes of
profit on capital, which render possible the rapid accumulation
of fortunes, are simply forms of taxation, by individuals, on
labor, purchase, or transport; and are highly detrimental to
the national interests, being, indeed, no means of national gain,
but only the abstraction of small gains from many to form the
large gain of one. For, though inequality of fortune is not in
itself an evil, but in many respects desirable, it is always an
evil when unjustly or stealthily obtained, since the men who
desire to make fortunes by large interest are precisely those
who will make the worst use of their wealth.</p>

<p>2. Capital sunk in the production of objects which do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
immediately support life (as statues, pictures, architecture,
books, garden-flowers, and the like) is beneficially sunk if the
things thus produced are good of their kind, and honestly
desired by the nation for their own sake; but it is sunk ruinously
if they are bad of their kind, or desired only for pride or
gain. Neither can good art be produced as an "investment."
You cannot build a good cathedral if you only build it that you
may charge sixpence for entrance.</p>

<p>3. "Private enterprise" should never be interfered with,
but, on the contrary, much encouraged, so long as it is indeed
"enterprise" (the exercise of individual ingenuity and audacity
in new fields of true labor), and so long as it is indeed "private,"
paying its way at its own cost, and in no wise harmfully
affecting public comforts or interests. But "private enterprise"
which poisons its neighborhood, or speculates for individual
gain at common risk, is very sharply to be interfered
with.</p>

<p>4. All enterprise, constantly and demonstrably profitable
on ascertained conditions, should be made public enterprise,
under Government administration and security; and the funds
now innocently contributed, and too often far from innocently
absorbed, in vain speculation, as noted in your correspondent
"Fair Play's" excellent letter,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> ought to be received by Government,
employed by it, not in casting guns, but in growing
corn and feeding cattle, and the largest possible legitimate
interest returned without risk to these small and variously occupied
capitalists who cannot look after their own money.
We should need another kind of Government to do this for
us, it is true; also it is true that we can get it, if we choose;
but we must recognize the duties of governors before we can
elect the men fit to perform them.</p>

<p>The benefit of these several modes of right investment of
capital would be quickly felt by the nation, not in the increase
of isolated or nominal wealth, but in steady lowering of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
prices of all the necessaries and innocent luxuries of life, and
in the disciplined, orderly, and in that degree educational
employment of every able-bodied person. For, Sir (again with
your pardon), my question "Is England big enough?" was
not answered by the sad experience of the artisans of Poplar.
Had they been employed in earth-building instead of in shipbuilding,
and heaped the Isle of Dogs itself into half as much
space of good land, capable of growing corn instead of mosquitoes,
they would actually have made habitable England a little
bigger by this time;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and if the first principle of economy in
employment were understood among us&mdash;namely, always to
use whatever vital power of breath and muscle you have got in
the country before you use the artificial power of steam and
iron for what living arms can do, and never plough by steam
while you forward your ploughmen to Quebec&mdash;those old
familiar faces need not yet have looked their last at each other
from the deck of the St. Lawrence. But on this subject I will
ask your permission to write you in a few days some further
words.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

the "Increased Railway Fares," in which, commenting on Mr. Ruskin's
statement that, given the law of political economy, the railways might ask
as much as they could get, it is said that Mr. Ruskin mistook "the charge
against the companies. While they neglected the 'law of supply and
demand,' they suffered: now that they obey that law, they prosper." The
latter part of the article dealt with a long letter signed "Fair Play," which
was printed in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of the same day. "To Mr. Ruskin,
who laughs at Political Economy," concluded the article; "and to 'Fair
Play,' who thinks that Parliament is at the bottom of all the mischief, we
commend a significant fact. An agitation is now on foot in Brighton to
have a second railway direct to London. What is the cause of this? Not
the Legislature, but the conduct of the Brighton company in raising its
fares. That board, by acting in the spirit of a monopoly, has provoked
retaliation, and the public now seeks to protect itself by the aid of a competing
line."

The letter of the correspondent "S." (also in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of

the Government works the railways on the principle of the Post Office."</p></div>

<i>OUR RAILWAY SYSTEM.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Will you allow me a few words with reference to your
excellent article of to-day on railroads.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> All you say is true. But
of what use is it to tell the public this? Of all the economical
stupidities of the public&mdash;and they are many&mdash;the out-and-out
stupidest is underpaying their pointsmen; but if the said public
choose always to leave their lines in the hands of companies&mdash;that
is to say, practically, of engineers and lawyers&mdash;the money
they pay for fares will always go, most of it, into the engineers'
and lawyers' pockets. It will be spent in decorating railroad
stations with black and blue bricks, and in fighting bills for
branch lines. I hear there are more bills for new lines to be
brought forward this year than at any previous session. But,
Sir, it might do some little good if you were to put it into the
engineers' and lawyers' heads that they might for some time to
come get as much money for themselves (and a little more safety
for the public) by bringing in bills for doubling laterally the
present lines as for ramifying them; and if you were also to
explain to the shareholders that it would be wiser to spend
their capital in preventing accidents attended by costly damages,
than in running trains at a loss on opposition branches. It is
little business of mine&mdash;for I am not a railroad traveller usually
more than twice in the year; but I don't like to hear of people's
being smashed, even when it is all their fault; so I will
ask you merely to reprint this passage from my article on
Political Economy in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for April, 1863, and
so leave the matter to your handling:</p>

<p>"Had the money spent in local mistakes and vain private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
litigation on the railroads of England been laid out, instead,

work, and had no absurd expense been incurred in ornamenting
stations, we might already have had&mdash;what ultimately it
will be found we must have&mdash;quadruple rails, two for passengers
and two for traffic, on every great line, and we might have
been carried in swift safety, and watched and warded by well-paid
pointsmen, for half the present fares."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<i>DOMESTIC SERVANTS&mdash;MASTERSHIP.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: You so seldom write nonsense, that you will, I am
sure, pardon your friends for telling you when you do. Your
article on servants to-day is nonsense. It is just as easy and as
difficult now to get good servants as it ever was.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> You may
have them, as you may have pines and peaches, for the growing,
or you may even buy them good, if you can persuade the
good growers to spare you them off their walls; but you cannot
get them by political economy and the law of supply and
demand.</p>

<p>There are broadly two ways of making good servants; the
first, a sound, wholesome, thoroughgoing slavery&mdash;which was
the heathen way, and no bad one neither, provided you understand
that to make real "slaves" you must make yourself a
real "master" (which is not easy). The second is the Christian's
way: "whoso delicately bringeth up his servant from a child,
shall have him become his son at the last."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> And as few
people want their servants to become their sons, this is not a
way to their liking. So that, neither having courage or self-discipline
enough on the one hand to make themselves nobly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>dominant after the heathen fashion, nor tenderness or justice
enough to make themselves nobly protective after the Christian,
the present public thinks to manufacture servants bodily out
of powder and hay-stuffing&mdash;mentally by early instillation of
Catechism and other mechanico-religious appliances&mdash;and
economically, as you helplessly suggest, by the law of supply
and demand,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> with such results as we all see, and most of us
more or less feel, and shall feel daily more and more to our
cost and selfish sorrow.</p>

<p>Sir, there is only one way to have good servants; that is,
to be worthy of being well served. All nature and all
humanity will serve a good master, and rebel against an ignoble
one. And there is no surer test of the quality of a nation
than the quality of its servants, for they are their masters'
shadows, and distort their faults in a flattened mimicry. A
wise nation will have philosophers in its servants' hall; a
knavish nation will have knaves there; and a kindly nation will
have friends there. Only let it be remembered that "kindness"
means, as with your child, so with your servant, not
indulgence, but care.&mdash;I am, Sir, seeing that you usually write
good sense, and "serve" good causes, your servant to command.</p>

be more <i>ad rem</i> than Mr. Ruskin's eloquent axioms," it concluded by

<i>DOMESTIC SERVANTS&mdash;EXPERIENCE.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I thank you much for your kind insertion of my
letter, and your courteous and graceful answer to it. Others
will thank you also; for your suggestions are indeed much
more <i>ad rem</i> than my mere assertions of principle; but both
are necessary. Statements of practical difficulty, and the
immediate means of conquering it, are precisely what the
editor of a powerful daily journal is able to give; but he cannot
give them justly if he ever allow himself to lose sight of
the eternal laws which in their imperative bearings manifest
themselves more clearly to the retired student of human life
in the phases of its history. My own personal experience&mdash;if
worth anything&mdash;has been simply that wherever I myself
knew how a thing should be done, and was resolved to have it
done, I could always get subordinates, if made of average good
human material, to do it, and that, on the whole, cheerfully,
thoroughly, and even affectionately; and my wonder is usually
rather at the quantity of service they are willing to do for
me, than at their occasional indolences, or fallings below the
standard of seraphic wisdom and conscientiousness. That they
<i>shall</i> be of average human material, it is, as you wisely point
out, every householder's business to make sure. We cannot
choose our relations, but we can our servants; and what
sagacity we have and knowledge of human nature cannot be
better employed. If your house is to be comfortable, your
servants' hearts must be sound, as the timber and stones of its
walls; and there must be discretion in the choice, and time
allowed for the "settling" of both. The luxury of having
pretty servants must be paid for, like all luxuries, in the
penalty of their occasional loss; but I fancy the best sort of
female servant is generally in aspect and general qualities like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Sydney Smith's "Bunch,"<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and a very retainable creature.
And for the rest, the dearth of good service, if such there be,
may perhaps wholesomely teach us that, if we were all a little
more in the habit of serving ourselves in many matters, we
should be none the worse or the less happy.</p>

<h3>[From "The Daily Telegraph," September 18, 1865.]<br />

<i>DOMESTIC SERVANTS: SONSHIP AND SLAVERY.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have been watching the domestic correspondence in
your columns with much interest, and thought of offering you
a short analysis of it when you saw good to bring it to a close,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
and perhaps a note or two of my own experience, being somewhat
conceited on the subject just now, because I have a
gardener who lets me keep old-fashioned plants in the
greenhouse, understands that my cherries are grown for the
blackbirds, and sees me gather a bunch of my own grapes without
making a wry face. But your admirable article of yesterday
causes me to abandon my purpose; the more willingly,
because among all the letters you have hitherto published there
is not one from any head of a household which contains a com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>plaint
worth notice. All the masters or mistresses whose letters
are thoughtful or well written say they get on well enough with
their servants; no part has yet been taken in the discussion by
the heads of old families. The servants' letters, hitherto,
furnish the best data; but the better class of servants are also
silent, and must remain so. Launce, Grumio, or Fairservice<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
may have something to say for themselves; but you will hear
nothing from Old Adam nor from carefu' Mattie. One proverb
from Sancho, if we could get it, would settle the whole
business for us; but his master and he are indeed "no more."
I would have walked down to Dulwich to hear what Sam
Weller had to say; but the high-level railway went through
Mr. Pickwick's parlor two months ago, and it is of no use
writing to Sam, for, as you are well aware, he is no penman.
And, indeed, Sir, little good will come of any writing on the
matter. "The cat will mew, the dog will have his day." You
yourself, excellent as is the greater part of what you have
said, and to the point, speak but vainly when you talk of
"probing the evil to the bottom." This is no sore that can
be probed, no sword nor bullet wound. This is a plague spot.
Small or great, it is in the significance of it, not in the depth,
that you have to measure it. It is essentially bottomless, cancerous;
a putrescence through the constitution of the people is
indicated by this galled place. Because I know this thoroughly,
I say so little, and that little, as your correspondents think,
who know nothing of me, and as you say, who might have
known more of me, unpractically. Pardon me, I am no seller
of plasters, nor of ounces of civet. The patient's sickness is
his own fault, and only years of discipline will work it out of
him. That is the only really "practical" saying that can be
uttered to him. The relation of master and servant involves
every other&mdash;touches every condition of moral health through
the State. Put that right, and you put all right; but you will
find it can only come ultimately, not primarily, right; you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>cannot begin with it. Some of the evidence you have got
together is valuable, many pieces of partial advice very good.
You need hardly, I think, unless you wanted a type of British
logic, have printed a letter in which the writer accused (or
would have accused, if he had possessed Latinity enough) all
London servants of being thieves because he had known one
robbery to have been committed by a nice-looking girl.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But
on the whole there is much common-sense in the letters; the
singular point in them all, to my mind, being the in-apprehension
of the breadth and connection of the question, and the
general resistance to, and stubborn rejection of, the abstract
ideas of sonship and slavery, which include whatever is possible
in wise treatment of servants. It is very strange to see that,
while everybody shrinks at abstract suggestions of there being
possible error in a book of Scripture,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> your sensible English
housewife fearlessly rejects Solomon's opinion when it runs
slightly counter to her own, and that not one of your many
correspondents seems ever to have read the Epistle to Philemon.
It is no less strange that while most English boys of
ordinary position hammer through their Horace at one or other
time of their school life, no word of his wit or his teaching
seems to remain by them: for all the good they get out of
them, the Satires need never have been written. The Roman
gentleman's account of his childhood and of his domestic life
possesses no charm for them: and even men of education
would sometimes start to be reminded that his "<i>noctes c&aelig;n&aelig;que</i>
<i>Deum</i>!" meant supping with his merry slaves on beans and
bacon. Will you allow me, on this general question of liberty
and slavery, to refer your correspondents to a paper of mine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>touching closely upon it, the leader in the <i>Art-Journal</i> for
July last? and to ask them also to meditate a little over the
two beautiful epitaphs on Epictetus and Zosima, quoted in the
last paper of the <i>Idler</i>?<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I, Epictetus, was a slave; and sick in body, and wretched in poverty; and beloved by the gods."</p>

<p>"Zosima, who while she lived was a slave only in her body, has now found deliverance for that also."</p></div>

<p>How might we, over many an "independent" Englishman,
reverse this last legend, and write&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This man, who while he lived was free only in his body, has
now found captivity for that also."</p></div>

<p>I will not pass without notice&mdash;for it bears also on wide
interests&mdash;your correspondent's question, how my principles differ
from the ordinary economist's view of supply and demand.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
Simply in that the economy I have taught, in opposition to
the popular view, is the science which not merely ascertains
the relations of existing demand and supply, but determines
what <i>ought</i> to be demanded and what <i>can</i> be supplied. A
child demands the moon, and, the supply not being in this case
equal to the demand, is wisely accommodated with a rattle; a
footpad demands your purse, and is supplied according to the
less or more rational economy of the State, with that or a
halter; a foolish nation, not able to get into its head that free
trade does indeed mean the removal of taxation from its imports,
but not of supervision from them, demands unlimited
foreign beef, and is supplied with the cattle murrain and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>like. There may be all manner of demands, all manner of
supplies. The true political economist regulates these; the
false political economist leaves them to be regulated by (not
Divine) Providence. For, indeed, the largest final demand
anywhere reported of, is that of hell; and the supply of it (by
the broad-gauge line) would be very nearly equal to the demand
at this day, unless there were here and there a swineherd or
two who could keep his pigs out of sight of the lake.</p>

<p>Thus in this business of servants everything depends on
what sort of servant you at heart wish for or "demand." If
for nurses you want Charlotte Winsors, they are to be had for
money; but by no means for money, such as that German girl
who, the other day, on her own scarce-floating fragment of
wreck, saved the abandoned child of another woman, keeping
it alive by the moisture from her lips.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> What kind of servant
do you want? It is a momentous question for you yourself&mdash;for
the nation itself. Are we to be a nation of shopkeepers,
wanting only shop-boys; or of manufacturers, wanting only
hands; or are there to be knights among us, who will need
squires&mdash;captains among us, needing crews? Will you have
clansmen for your candlesticks, or silver plate? Myrmidons
at your tents, ant-born, or only a mob on the Gillies Hill?
Are you resolved that you will never have any but your inferiors
to serve you, or shall Enid ever lay your trencher with
tender little thumb, and Cinderella sweep your hearth, and be
cherished there? It <i>might</i> come to that in time, and plate
and hearth be the brighter; but if your servants are to be held
your inferiors, at least be sure they <i>are</i> so, and that you are
indeed wiser, and better-tempered, and more useful than they.
Determine what their education ought to be, and organize
proper servants' schools, and there give it them. So they will
be fit for their position, and will do honor to it, and stay in it:
let the masters be as sure they do honor to theirs, and are as
willing to stay in that. Remember that every people which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>gives itself to the pursuit of riches, invariably, and of necessity,
gets the scum uppermost in time, and is set by the genii,
like the ugly bridegroom in the Arabian Nights, at its own
door with its heels in the air, showing its shoe-soles instead of
a Face. And the reversal is a serious matter, if reversal be
even possible, and it comes right end uppermost again, instead
of to conclusive Wrong end.</p>

<p>I suppose I am getting unpractical again. Well, here is one
practical morsel, and I have done. One or two of your correspondents
have spoken of the facilities of servants for leaving
their places. Drive that nail home, Sir. A large stray
branch of the difficulty lies there. Many and many a time I
have heard Mr. Carlyle speak of this, and too often I have felt
it myself as one of the evils closely accompanying the fever of
modern change in the habits and hopes of life. My own architectural
work drives me to think of it continually. Round
every railroad station, out of the once quiet fields, there bursts
up first a blotch of brick-fields, and then of ghastly houses,
washed over with slime into miserable fineries of cornice and
portico. A gentleman would hew for himself a log hut, and
thresh for himself a straw bed, before he would live in such;
but the builders count safely on tenants&mdash;people who know
no quietness nor simplicity of pleasure, who care only for the
stucco, and lodge only in the portico, of human life&mdash;understanding
not so much as the name of House or House-<i>Hold</i>.
They and their servants are always "bettering themselves"
divergently.</p>

<p>You will do good service at least in teaching any of these
who will listen to you, that if they can once make up their
minds to a fixed state of life, and a fixed income, and a fixed
expenditure&mdash;if they can by any means get their servants to
stay long enough with them to fit into their places and know
the run of the furrows&mdash;then something like service and mastership,
and fulfilment of understood and reciprocal duty, may
become possible; no otherwise. I leave this matter to your
better handling, and will trespass on your patience no more.
Only, as I think you will get into some disgrace with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
lady correspondents for your ungallant conclusions respecting
them<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>&mdash;which I confess surprised me a little, though I might
have been prepared for it if I had remembered what order the
husband even of so good a housewife as Penelope was obliged
to take with some of her female servants after prolonged
absence,&mdash;I have translated a short passage of Xenophon's
Economics<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> for you, which may make your peace if you will
print it. I wish the whole book were well translated; meantime,
your lady readers must be told that this is part of a
Greek country gentleman's account of the conversation he had
with his young wife (a girl of fifteen only), a little while after
their marriage, when "she had got used to him," and was not
frightened at being spoken gravely to. First they pray together;
and then they have a long happy talk, of which this is
the close:</p>

<p>"But there is one of the duties belonging to you," I said,
"which, perhaps will be more painful to you than any other,
namely, the care of your servants when they are ill." "Nay,"
answered my wife, "that will be the most pleasing of all my
duties to me, if only my servants will be grateful when I minister
rightly to them, and will love me better." And I, pleased
with her answer, said, "Indeed, lady, it is in some such way as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>this that the queen of the hive is so regarded by her bees, that,
if she leave the hive, none will quit her, but all will follow her."
Then she answered, "I should wonder if this office of leader
were not yours rather than mine, for truly my care and distribution
of things would be but a jest were it not for your inbringing."
"Yes," I said, "but what a jest would my inbringing
be if there were no one to take care of what I brought. Do not
you know how those are pitied of whom it is fabled that they
have always to pour water into a pierced vessel?" "Yes; and
they <i>are</i> unhappy, if in truth they do it," said she. "Then
also," I said, "remember your other personal cares. Will all
be sweet to you when, taking one of your maidens who knows
not how to spin, you teach her, and make her twice the girl she
was; or one who has no method nor habit of direction, and you
teach her how to manage a house, and make her faithful and
mistress-like and every way worthy, and when you have the
power of benefiting those who are orderly and useful in the
house, and of punishing any one who is manifestly disposed to
evil? But what will be sweetest of all, if it may come to pass,
will be that you should show yourself better even than <i>me</i>, and
so make me your servant also: so that you need not fear in
advancing age to be less honored in my house; but may have
sure hope that in becoming old, by how much more you have
become also a noble fellow-worker with me, and joint guardian
of our children's possessions, by so much shall you be more honored
in my household. For what is lovely and good increases
for all men&mdash;not through fairness of the body, but through
strength and virtue in things pertaining to life." And this is
what I remember chiefly of what we said in our first talk together.</p>

<h3>[From "The Daily Telegraph," October 17, 1865.]<br />

<i>MODERN HOUSES.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I trust you will hold the very able and interesting letter
from "W. H. W.,"<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> which you publish to-day, excuse enough
for my briefly trespassing on your space once more. Indeed,
it has been a discomfort to me that I have not yet asked the
pardon of your correspondent, "A Tenant, not at will" (Sept.
21),<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> for the apparent discourtesy of thought of which he
accused me. He need not have done so: for although I said
"a gentleman would hew for himself a log hut" rather than
live in modern houses, I never said he would rather abandon
his family and his business than live in them; and your correspondent
himself, in his previously written letter, had used
precisely the same words. And he must not suspect that I
intend to be ironical in saying that the prolonged coincidence
of thought and word in the two letters well deserves the notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>of your readers, in the proof it gives of the strength and truth
of the impression on both minds. "W. H. W.'s" graphic
description of his house is also sorrowfully faithful to the facts
of daily experience; and I doubt not that you will soon have
other communications of the same tenor, and all too true.</p>

<p>I made no attempt to answer "A Tenant, not at will,"
because the subject is much too wide for any detailed treatment
in a letter; and you do not care for generalizations of
mine. But I am sure your two correspondents, and the large
class of sufferers which they represent, would be very sincerely
grateful for some generalizations of yours on this matter. For,
Sir, surely of all questions for the political economist, this of
putting good houses over people's heads is the closest and
simplest. The first question in all economy, practically as well
as etymologically, must be this, of lodging. The "Eco" must
come before the "Nomy." You must have a house before
you can put anything into it; and preparatorily to laying up
treasure, at the least dig a hole for it. Well, Sir, here, as it
seems to my poor thinking, is a beautiful and simple problem
for you to illustrate the law of demand and supply upon.
Here you have a considerable body of very deserving persons
"demanding" a good and cheap article in the way of a house.
Will you or any of your politico-economic correspondents
explain to them and to me the Divinely Providential law by
which, in due course, the supply of such cannot but be brought
about for them?</p>

<p>There is another column in your impression of to-day to
which, also, I would ask leave to direct your readers' attention&mdash;the
4th of the 3d page; and especially, at the bottom of it,
Dr. Whitmore's account of Crawford Place,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and his following
statement that it is "a kind of property constituting a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>profitable investment;" and I do so in the hope that you will
expand your interpretation of the laws of political economy
so far as to teach us how, by their beneficent and inevitable
operation, good houses must finally be provided for the classes
who live in Crawford Place, and such other places; and, without
necessity of eviction, also for the colliers of Cramlington
(<i>vide</i> 2d column of the same 3d page).<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> I have, indeed, my
own notions on the subject, but I do not trouble you with them,
for they are unfortunately based an that wild notion of there
being a "just" price for all things, which you say in your
article of Oct. 10, on the Sheffield strikes, "has no existence
but in the minds of theorists."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, with
which journal I have already held some discussion on the subject,
eagerly quoted your authority on its side, in its impression
of the same evening; nor do I care to pursue the debate until
I can inform you of the continuous result of some direct results
which I am making on my Utopian principles. I have bought
a little bit of property of the Crawford Place description, and
mending it somewhat according to my notions, I make my
tenants pay me what I hold to be a "just" price for the lodging
provided. That lodging I partly look after, partly teach the
tenants to look after for themselves; and I look a little after
them, as well as after the rents. I do not mean to make a
highly profitable investment of their poor little rooms; but I do
mean to sell a good article, in the way of house room, at a fair
price; and hitherto my customers are satisfied, and so am I.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time, being entirely busy in other directions,
I must leave the discussion, if it is to proceed at all, wholly
between you and your readers. I will write no word more till
I see what they all have got to say, and until you yourself have
explained to me, in its anticipated results, the working&mdash;as
regards the keeping out of winter and rough weather&mdash;of the
principles of Non-iquity (I presume that is the proper politico-economic
form for the old and exploded word Iniquity); and
so I remain, Sir, yours, etc.,</p>

"one of an ugly mass of blossoms lately burst forth from the parent trunk&mdash;a
brickfield;" and declared that if it were not that people would think
him mad, he "would infinitely rather live in a log hut of his own building"
than in a builder's villa. He concluded by saying that all the houses were
the same, and that therefore, until Mr. Ruskin could point out honest-built
dwellings neglected while the "villas" were all let, it was not quite fair of
him to assume that "suburban villains" utterly wanted the true instinct

<i>A KING'S FIRST DUTY.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: May I ask you to add to your article on the inundation
of the Tiber some momentary invitation to your readers to
think with Horace rather than to smile with him?</p>

<p>In the briefest and proudest words he wrote of himself he
thought of his native land chiefly as divided into the two districts
of violent and scanty waters:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dicar, qua violens obstrepit Aufidus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et qua, pauper aqu&aelig;, Daunus agrestium<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regnavit populorum."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now the anger and power of that "tauriformis Aufidus" is
precisely because "regna Dauni pr&aelig;fluit"&mdash;because it flows
past the poor kingdoms which it should enrich. Stay it there,
and it is treasure instead of ruin. And so also with Tiber and
Eridanus. They are so much gold, at their sources&mdash;they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
so much death, if they once break down unbridled into the
plains.</p>

<p>At the end of your report of the events of the inundation,
it is said that the King of Italy expressed "an earnest desire to
do something, as far as science and industry could effect it, to
prevent or mitigate inundations for the future."</p>

<p>Now science and industry can do, not "something," but
everything, and not merely to mitigate inundations&mdash;and,
deadliest of inundations, because perpetual, maremmas&mdash;but to
change them into national banks instead of debts.</p>

<p>The first thing the King of any country has to do is to
manage the streams of it.</p>

<p>If he can manage the streams, he can also the people; for
the people also form alternately torrent and maremma, in pestilential
fury or pestilential idleness. They also will change
into living streams of men, if their Kings literally "lead them
forth beside the waters of comfort." Half the money lost by
this inundation of Tiber, spent rightly on the hill-sides last
summer, would have changed every wave of it into so much
fruit and foliage in spring where now there will be only burning
rock. And the men who have been killed within the last
two months, and whose work, and the money spent in doing it,
have filled Europe with misery which fifty years will not efface,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
they had been set at the same cost to do good instead of evil,
and to save life instead of destroying it, might, by this 10th of
January, 1871, have embanked every dangerous stream at the
roots of the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Po, and left to Germany,
to France, and to Italy an inheritance of blessing for
centuries to come&mdash;they and their families living all the while
in brightest happiness and peace. And now! Let the Red
Prince look to it; red inundation bears also its fruit in time.</p>

"sparkling," "light-hearted" ode of Horace, "Jam satis terris nivis"

<i>A NATION'S DEFENCES.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The letter to which you do me the honor to refer, in
your yesterday's article on the Tiber, entered into no detail,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
because I had already laid the plans spoken of before the Royal
Institution in my lecture there last February;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> in which my
principal object was to state the causes of the incalculably
destructive inundations of the Rhone, Toccia, and Ticino, in
1868; and to point out that no mountain river ever was or can
be successfully embanked in the valleys; but that the rainfall
must be arrested on the high and softly rounded hill surfaces,
before it reaches any ravine in which its force can be concentrated.
Every mountain farm ought to have a dike about two
feet high&mdash;with a small ditch within it&mdash;carried at intervals in
regular, scarcely perceptible incline across its fields; with discharge
into a reservoir large enough to contain a week's maximum
rainfall on the area of that farm in the stormiest weather-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>the
higher uncultivated land being guarded over larger spaces
with bolder embankments. No drop of water that had once
touched hill ground ought ever to reach the plains till it was
wanted there: and the maintenance of the bank and reservoir,
once built, on any farm, would not cost more than the keeping
up of its cattle-sheds against chance of whirlwind and snow.</p>

<p>The first construction of the work would be costly enough;
and, say the Economists, "would not pay." I never heard of
any National Defences that did! Presumably, we shall have
to pay more income-tax next year, without hope of any dividend
on the disbursement. Nay&mdash;you must usually wait a
year or two before you get paid for any great work, even when
the gain is secure. The fortifications of Paris did not pay, till
very lately; they are doubtless returning cent. per cent. now,
since the kind of rain falls heavy within them which they were
meant to catch. Our experimental embankments against (perhaps
too economically cheap) shot at Shoeburyness are property
which we can only safely "realize" under similarly favorable
conditions. But my low embankments would not depend for
their utility on the advent of a hypothetical foe, but would
have to contend with an instant and inevitable one; yet with
one who is only an adversary if unresisted; who, resisted, becomes
a faithful friend&mdash;a lavish benefactor.</p>

<p>Give me the old bayonets in the Tower, if I can't have
anything so good as spades; and a few regiments of "volunteers"
with good Engineer officers over them, and, in three
years' time, an Inundation of Tiber, at least, shall be Impossible.</p>

liberty, but the right government of both."</p>

<i>THE WATERS OF COMFORT.</i></h3>


<p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I did not see your impression of yesterday until too

and I am hurried to-day; but will send you to-morrow a precise
statement of what I believe can be done in the Italian
uplands. The simplest and surest beginning would be the purchase,
either by the Government or by a small company formed
in Rome, of a few plots of highland in the Apennines, now
barren for want of water, and valueless; and the showing what
could be made of them by terraced irrigation such as English
officers have already introduced in many parts of India. The
Agricultural College at Cirencester ought, I think, to be able
to send out two or three superintendents, who would direct
rightly the first processes of cultivation, choosing for purchase
good soil in good exposures, and which would need only irrigation
to become fruitful; and by next summer, if not by the
end of this, there would be growing food for men and cattle
where now there is only hot dust; and I do not think there
would be much further question "where the money was to
come from." The real question is only, "Will you <i>pay</i> your
money in advance for what is actually new land added to the
kingdom of living Italy?" or "Will you pay it under call from
the Tiber every ten or twenty years as the price of the work
done by the river for your destruction?"</p>

<h3>[From "The Daily Telegraph," February 7, 1871.]<br />

<i>THE STREAMS OF ITALY.</i><a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In this month, just thirty years ago, I was at Naples,
and the days were nearly as dark as these, but with clouds and
rain, not fog. The streets leading down from St. Elmo became
beds of torrents. A story went about&mdash;true or not I do not
know, but credible enough&mdash;of a child's having been carried
off by the gutter and drowned at the bottom of the hill. At
last came indeed what, in those simple times, people thought a
serious loss of life. A heavy storm burst one night above a
village on the flank of the Monte St. Angelo, a mile or two
south of Pompeii. The limestones slope steeply there under
about three feet of block earth. The water peeled a piece of
the rock of its earth, as one would peel an orange, and brought
down three or four acres of the good soil in a heap on the
village at midnight, driving in the upper walls, and briefly
burying some fourteen or fifteen people in their sleep&mdash;and,
as I say, in those times there was some talk even about fourteen
or fifteen. But the same kind of thing takes place, of
course, more or less, among the hills in almost every violent
storm, generally with the double result of ruining more ground
below than is removed from the rocks above; for the frantic
streams mostly finish their work with a heap of gravel and
blocks of stone like that which came down the ravine below
the glacier of Greppond about ten years ago, and destroyed,
for at least fifty years to come, some of quite the best land in
Chamouni.</p>

<p>In slower, but ceaseless process of ruin, the Po, Arno, and
Tiber steadily remove the soil from the hills, and carry it down
to their deltas. The Venetians have contended now for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
thousand years in vain even with the Brenta and the minor
streams that enter their lagoons, and have only kept their
canals clear by turning the river south to Malamocco with
embankments which have unhealthily checked the drainage of
all the flat country about Padua.</p>

<p>And this constant mischief takes place, be it observed, irrespective
of inundation. All that Florence, Pisa, and Rome
have suffered and suffer periodically from floods is so much
mischief added to that of increasing maremmas, spoiled harborages,
and lost mountain-ground.</p>

<p>There is yet one further evil. The snow on the bared rock
slips lower and melts faster; snow, which in mossy or grass
ground would have lain long, and furnished steadily flowing
streams far on into summer, fall or melt from the bare rock in
avalanche and flood, and spend in desolation in a few days
what would have been nourishment for half the year. And
against all this there are no remedies possible in any sudden or
external action. It is the law of the Heaven which sends
flood and food, that national prosperity can only be achieved
by national forethought and unity of purpose.</p>

<p>In the year 1858 I was staying the greater part of the summer
at Bellinzona, during a drought as harmful as the storms
of ten years later. The Ticino sank into a green rivulet; and
not having seen the right way to deal with the matter, I had
many a talk with the parroco of a little church whose tower I
was drawing, as to the possibility of setting his peasants to
work to repair the embankment while the river was low. But
the good old priest said, sorrowfully, the peasants were too
jealous of each other, that no one would build anything or
protect his own ground for fear his work might also benefit
his neighbors.</p>

<p>But the people of Bellinzona are Swiss, not Italians. I
believe the Roman and Sienese races, in different ways, possess
qualities of strength and gentleness far more precious than
the sunshine and rain upon their mountains, and, hitherto, as
cruelly lost. It is in them that all the real power of Italy
still lives; it is only by them, and by what care, and provi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>dence,
and accordant good-will ever be found in them, that the
work is to be done, not by money; though, if money were all
that is needed, do we in England owe so little to Italy of
delight that we cannot so much as lend her spades and pick-axes
at her need? Would she trust us? Would her government
let us send over some engineer officers and a few sappers
and miners, and bear, for a time, with an English instead of a
French "occupation" of her barrenest hills?</p>

<p>But she does not need us. Good engineers she has, and
has had many since Leonardo designed the canals of Lombardy.
Agriculturists she has had, I think, among her gentlemen a
little before there were gentlemen farmers in England; something
she has told us of agriculture, also, pleasantly by the reeds
of Mincio and among the apple-blossoms wet with Arno. Her
streams have learned obedience before now: Fonte Branda and
the Fountain of Joy flow at Sienna still; the rivulets that
make green the slopes of Casentino may yet satisfy true men's
thirst. "Where is the money to come from?" Let Italy keep
her souls pure, and she will not need to alloy her florins. The
only question for her is whether still the mossy rock and the
"rivus aqu&aelig;" are "in rotis" or rather the racecourse and the
boulevard&mdash;the curses of England and of France.</p>

<p>At all events, if any one of the Princes of Rome will lead,
help enough will follow to set the work on foot, and show the
peasants, in some narrow district, what can be done. Take any
arid piece of Apennine towards the sources of the Tiber; let
the drainage be carried along the hill-sides away from the
existing water-courses; let cisterns, as of old in Palestine, and
larger reservoirs, such as we now can build, be established at
every point convenient for arrest of the streams; let channels
of regulated flow be established from these over the tracts that
are driest in summer; let ramparts be carried, not along the
river banks, but round the heads of the ravines, throwing the
water aside into lateral canals; then terrace and support the
looser soil on all the steeper slopes; and the entire mountain
side may be made one garden of orange and vine and olive
beneath; and a wide blossoming orchard above; and a green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
highest pasture for cattle, and flowers for bees&mdash;up to the edge
of the snows of spring.</p>

<i>THE STREETS OF LONDON.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have been every day on the point of writing to you
since your notice, on the 18th,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> of the dirty state of the London
streets, to ask whether any of your readers would care to
know how such matters are managed in my neighborhood. I
was obliged, a few years ago, for the benefit of my health, to
take a small house in one of the country towns of Utopia; and
though I was at first disappointed in the climate, which indeed
is no better than our own (except that there is no foul marsh
air), I found my cheerfulness and ability for work greatly
increased by the mere power of getting exercise pleasantly close
to my door, even in the worst of the winter, when, though I have
a little garden at the back of my house, I dislike going into it,
because the things look all so dead; and find my walk on the
whole pleasanter in the streets, these being always perfectly
clean, and the wood-carving of the houses prettier than much
of our indoor furniture. But it was about the streets I wanted
to tell you. The Utopians have the oddest way of carrying
out things, when once they begin, as far as they can go; and
it occurred to them one dirty December long since, when they,
like us, had only crossing-sweepers, that they might just as
well sweep the whole of the street as the crossings of it, so
that they might cross anywhere. Of course that meant more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>work for the sweepers; but the Utopians have always hands
enough for whatever work is to be done in the open air;&mdash;they
appointed a due number of brooms-men to every quarter of the
town; and since then, at any time of the year, it is in our little
town as in great Rotterdam when Doctor Brown saw it on his
journey from Norwich to Colen in 1668, "the women go about
in white slippers," which is pretty to see.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Now, Sir, it
would, of course, be more difficult to manage anything like
this in London, because, for one thing, in our town we have a
rivulet running down every street that slopes to the river; and
besides, because you have coal-dust and smoke and what not to
deal with; and the habit of spitting, which is worst of all&mdash;in
Utopia, a man would as soon vomit as spit in the street (or
anywhere else, indeed, if he could help it). But still it is certain
we can at least anywhere do as much for the whole street,
as we have done for the crossing; and to show that we can, I
mean, on 1st January next, to take three street-sweepers into
constant service; they will be the first workpeople I employ
with the interest of the St. George's fund, of which I shall
get my first dividend this January; and, whenever I can get
leave from the police and inhabitants, I will keep my three
sweepers steadily at work for eight hours a day; and I hope
soon to show you a bit of our London streets kept as clean as
the deck of a ship of the line.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The letter you published yesterday from a parish
schoolboy of "Sixty Years Since" at Weary-faulds (confirmed
as it would be doubtless in all practical respects by testimony
of English boys educated at Waverley Honour) has my hearty
sympathy; but I am wearier than any tenant of Weary-faulds
of seeing this subject of education always treated as if "education"
only meant teaching children to write or to cipher or to
repeat catechism. You know, Sir, as you have shown by your
comments on the Bishop of Oxford's last speech on this subject,
and you could not at present use your influence more
beneficially than by farther showing that the real education-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>the
education which alone should be compulsory&mdash;means
nothing of the kind. It means teaching children to be clean,
active, honest, and useful. All these characters can be taught,
and cannot be acquired by sickly and ill-dispositioned children
without being taught; but they can be untaught to any extent,
by evil habit and example at home. Public schools, in which
the aim was to form character faithfully, would return to them
in due time to their parents, worth more than their "weight in
gold." That is the real answer to the objections founded on
economical difficulties. Will you not make some effort, Sir,
to get your readers to feel this? I am myself quite sick of
saying it over and over again in vain.</p>

Education," and that of January 29 one upon a speech of the Bishop
of Oxford on the same subject, made at a meeting in connection with the
National Society, held at Tunbridge Wells on the preceding day. In the
<i>Gazette</i> of January 30 appeared a letter referring to these articles, headed
"Sixty Years Ago," and signed "One who has walked four miles to the
Parish School." It described the writer's early home, situate in some lowland
parish north of the Tweed, and divided into five or six estates, such
as "Whinny-hills" and "Weary-faulds," the lairds of which were shortly
called "Whinny" or "Weary" after their properties. In this primitive
village, where supervision, much less compulsion, in education was never
heard of, "no child grew up without learning to read," and the morals of
the parish were on the whole good; the children quarrelled, but did not
steal.&mdash;The reader will remember that the second title of "Waverley" is
"'Tis Sixty Years Since."</p></div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>: I have your obliging letter, but am compelled
by increase of work to cease lecturing except at Oxford&mdash;and
practically there also&mdash;for, indeed, I find the desire of
audiences to be <i>audiences only</i> becoming an entirely pestilent
character of the age. Everybody wants to <i>hear</i>&mdash;nobody to
read&mdash;nobody to think; to be excited for an hour&mdash;and, if
possible, amused; to get the knowledge it has cost a man half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
his life to gather, first sweetened up to make it palatable, and
then kneaded into the smallest possible pills&mdash;and to swallow
it hom&#339;opathically and be wise&mdash;this is the passionate desire
and hope of the multitude of the day.</p>

<p>It is not to be done. A living comment quietly given to
a class on a book they are earnestly reading&mdash;this kind of lecture
is eternally necessary and wholesome; your modern fire-working,
smooth-downy-curry-and-strawberry-ice-and-milk-punch-altogether
lecture is an entirely pestilent and abominable
vanity; and the miserable death of poor Dickens, when he
might have been writing blessed books till he was eighty, but
for the pestiferous demand of the mob, is a very solemn warning
to us all, if we would take it.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<i>THE MORALITY OF FIELD SPORTS.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: As, thirty years ago,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> I publicly expressed a strong
opinion on the subject of field sports, and as with more accurate
knowledge I hold the same opinion still, and more strongly&mdash;will
you permit me to place the controversy between your
correspondents<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> in which I have no time to take part, on
somewhat clearer grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Reprobation of fox-hunting on the ground of cruelty to the
fox is entirely futile. More pain is caused to the draught-horses
of London in an hour by avariciously overloading them,
than to all the foxes in England by the hunts of the year: and
the rending of body and heart in human death, caused by
neglect, in our country cottages, in any one winter, could not
be equalled by the death-pangs of any quantity of foxes.</p>

<p>The real evils of fox-hunting are that it wastes the time,
misapplies the energy, exhausts the wealth, narrows the capacity,
debases the taste, and abates the honor of the upper classes of
this country; and instead of keeping, as your correspondent
"Forester" supposes, "thousands from the workhouse," it sends
thousands of the poor, both there, and into the grave.</p>

<p>The athletic training given by fox-hunting is excellent;
and such training is vitally necessary to the upper classes. But
it ought always to be in real service to their country; in
personal agricultural labor at the head of their tenantry; and
in extending English life and dominion in waste regions, against
the adverse powers of nature. Let them become Captains of
Emigration;&mdash;hunt down the foxes that spoil the Vineyard of
the World; and keep their eyes on the leading hound, in Packs
of Men.</p>

letters of considerable length, addressed to the editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>

already been carried on, whilst one of its leaders had strongly supported
Mr. Freeman's views. Other correspondence on the subject was still

<p><a name="Footnote_121_121" id="Footnote_121_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121_121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> At the annual meeting of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, Mr. Ruskin is reported (<i>Daily News</i>, July 11, 1877) to have said
that "as he was somewhat concerned in the studies of the scientific world,
it might be thought that he sympathized in the resistance offered, not
without some ground of reason, to some of the more enthusiastic and, he
feared in some respects, exaggerated and sentimental actions of the society.
He pleaded in the name of poor animals that none of them should act too
much on the feeling of pity, or without making a thoroughly judicial
inquiry. In looking at the report, he found part of the society's admirable
evidence mixed up with sentimental tales of fiction and other means of
exciting mere emotion, which had caused them to lose power with those
who had the greatest influence in the prevention of the abuses which the
society desired to check. The true justice of their cause lay in the relations
which men had had with animals from the time when both were made.
They had endeavored to prevent cruelty to animals; they had not enough
endeavored to promote affection for animals. He thought they had had
too much to do in the police courts, and not enough in the field and the
cottage garden. As one who was especially interested in the education of
the poor, he believed that he could not educate them on animals, but that
he could educate them by animals. He trusted to the pets of children for
their education just as much as to their tutors. He rejoiced in the separate
organization of the Ladies' Committee, and looked to it to give full extent
and power to action which would supersede all their expensive and painful
disputable duties. Without perfect sympathy with the animals around
them, no gentleman's education, no Christian education, could be of any
possible use. In concluding, he pleaded for an expansion of the protection
extended by the society to wild birds."</p>

<i>DRUNKENNESS AND CRIME.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Daily Telegraph."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I am greatly surprised by the slightness of your article
to-day on the statistics of drunkenness and the relative statistics
of crime.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The tables you have given, if given only in that form by
Professor Leone Levi, are anything but "instructive." Liquor
is not, for such purpose, to be measured only by the gallon,
but by the gallon with accompanying statement of strength.</p>

<p>Crime is not for such purpose to be measured by the
number of criminals, but by the number, with accompanying
statement of the crime committed. Drunkenness very slightly
encourages theft, very largely encourages murder, and universally
encourages idleness, which is not a crime apparent in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
tabular form. But, whatever results might, even by such more
accurate statement, be attainable, are not material to the
question at issue. Drunkenness is not the <i>cause</i> of crime in
any case. It <i>is</i> itself crime in every case. A gentleman will
not knock out his wife's brains when he is drunk; but it is
nevertheless his duty to remain sober.</p>

<p>Much more is it his duty to teach his peasantry to remain
sober, and to furnish them with sojourn more pleasant than
the pothouse, and means of amusement less circumscribed than
the pot. And the encouragement of drunkenness, for the sake
of the profit on sale of drink, is certainly one of the most
criminal methods of assassination for money hitherto adopted
by the bravos of an age or country.</p>

One of my best friends has just gone mad; and all the rest

indeed, there are numbers of people I should like to murder&mdash;I
won't say that I ought to be hanged; for I think nobody but

but it will do more if you complete it by pointing out the chief
reason for the frequent failure of almsgiving in accomplishing
any real benefit to the poor. No almsgiving of money is so
helpful as almsgiving of care and thought; the giving of
money without thought is indeed continually mischievous; but
the invective of the economist against <i>in</i>discriminate charity
is idle, if it be not coupled with pleading for discriminate
charity, and, above all, for that charity which discerns the uses
that people may be put to, and helps them by setting them to
work in those services. That is the help beyond all others,
find out how to make useless people useful, and let them earn

incapable of all occupation, none so faultful but that occupation,
well chosen, and kindly compelled, will be medicine for
them in soul and body. I have lately drawn up a few notes

<h3><i>NOTES ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EMPLOYMENT
FOR THE DESTITUTE AND CRIMINAL CLASSES.</i><br />

[For Private Circulation only. 1868. (Pp. 15, including the title-page. Printed by
Strangeways &amp; Walden, Castle Street, Leicester Square.)<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>]</h3>


<p>The first great fact on which all wise and enduring legislation
respecting labor must be founded, is, that the character of
men depends more on their occupations than on any teaching
we can give them, or principles with which we can imbue
them.</p>

<p>The employment forms the habits of body and mind, and
these are the constitution of the man&mdash;the greater part of his
moral or persistent nature, whatever effort, under special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>excitement, he may make to change or overcome them. Employment
is the half, and the primal half, of education&mdash;it is
the warp of it; and the fineness or the endurance of all subsequently
woven pattern depends wholly on its straightness and
strength. And whatever difficulty there may be in tracing
through past history the remoter connections of event and
cause, one chain of sequence is always clear: the formation,
namely, of the character of nations by their employments, and
the determination of their final fate by their character. The
moment and the first direction of circumstances, of decisive
revolutions, often depend on accident; but their persistent
course, and their consequences, depend wholly on the nature
of the people. The passing of the Reform Bill by the late
English Parliament<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> may have been more or less accidental:
the results of the measure now rest on the character of the
English people, as it has been developed by their recent interests,
occupations, and habits of life. Whether as a body, they
employ their new powers for good or evil will depend not on
their facilities for knowledge, nor even on the general intelligence
they may possess, but on the number of persons among
them whom wholesome employments have rendered familiar
with the duties, and temperate in their estimate of the promises
of life.</p>

<p>But especially in passing laws respecting the treatment or
employment of improvident and more or less vicious persons
it is to be remembered that as men are not to be made heroes
by an act of heroism, but must be brave before they can perform
it, so they are not made villains by the commission of a
crime, but were villains before they committed it; and that
the right of public interference with their conduct begins when
they begin to corrupt themselves, not merely at the moment
when they have proved themselves hopelessly corrupt.</p>

<p>All measures of reformation are effective in exact proportion
to their timeliness: partial decay may be cut away and
cleansed; incipient error corrected; but there is a point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
at which corruption can no more be stayed, nor wandering
recalled; it has been the manner of modern philanthropy to
remain passive until that precise period, and to leave the rich
to perish and the foolish to stray, while it exhausted itself in
frantic exertions to raise the dead and reform the dust.</p>

<p>The recent direction of a great weight of public opinion
against capital punishment is, I think, the sign of an awakening
perception that punishment is the last and worst instrument
in the hands of the legislature for the prevention of
crime.</p>

<p>The true instruments of reformation are employment and
reward&mdash;not punishment. Aid the willing, honor the virtuous,
and compel the idle into occupation, and there will be
no need for the compelling of any into the great and last indolence
of death. The beginning of all true reformation among
the criminal classes depends on the establishment of institutions
for their active employment, while their criminality is
still unripe, and their feelings of self-respect, capacities of
affection, and sense of justice not altogether quenched. That
those who are desirous of employment should be always able
to find it, will hardly, at the present day, be disputed; but
that those who are undesirous of employment should of all
persons be the most strictly compelled to it, the public are
hardly yet convinced. If the damage of the principal thoroughfares
in their capital city, and the multiplication of crimes
more ghastly than ever yet disgraced a nominal civilization, do
not convince them, they will not have to wait long before they
receive sterner lessons. For our neglect of the lower orders
has reached a point, at which it begins to bear its necessary
fruit, and every day makes the harvest darker and more sure.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The general principles by which employment should be
regulated may be briefly stated as follows:</p>

<p>1. There being three great classes of mechanical powers at
our disposal, namely, (<i>a</i>) vital muscular power; (<i>b</i>) natural
mechanical power of wind, water, and electricity; and (<i>c</i>) artificially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
produced mechanical power; it is the first principle of
economy to use all available vital power first, then the inexpensive
natural forces, and only at last to have recourse to artificial
power. And this, because it is always better for a man
to work with his own hands to feed and clothe himself, than
to stand idle while a machine works for him; and if he cannot
by all the labor healthily possible to him, feed and clothe himself,
then it is better to use an inexpensive machine&mdash;as a wind-mill
or water-mill&mdash;than a costly one like a steam-engine, so
long as we have natural force enough at our disposal. Whereas
at present we continually hear economists regret that the
water-powers of the cascades or streams of a country should be
lost, but hardly ever that the muscular power of its idle inhabitants
should be lost; and, again, we see vast districts, as the
south of Provence, where a strong wind<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> blows steady all day
long for six days out of seven throughout the year, without
a wind-mill, while men are continually employed a hundred
miles to the north, in digging fuel to obtain artificial power.</p>

<p>But the principal point of all to be kept in view is that in
every idle arm and shoulder throughout the country there is
a certain quantity of force, equivalent to the force of so much
fuel; and that it is mere insane waste to dig for coal for our
force, while the vital force is unused; and not only unused,
but, in being so, corrupting and polluting itself. We waste
our coal and spoil our humanity at one and the same instant.
Therefore, whenever there is an idle arm, always save coal
with it, and the stores of England will last all the longer.
And precisely the same argument answers the common one
about "taking employment out of the hands of the industrious
laborer." Why, what is "employment" but the putting out
of vital force instead of mechanical force? We are continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>in search of means of strength&mdash;to pull, to hammer, to fetch,
to carry; we waste our future resources to get power, while
we leave all the living fuel to burn itself out in mere pestiferous
breath and production of its variously noisome forms
of ashes! Clearly, if we want fire for force, we want men for
force first. The industrious hands <i>must</i> have so much to do
that they can do no more, or else we need not use machines to
help them: then use the idle hands first. Instead of dragging
petroleum with a steam-engine, put it on a canal, and drag it
with human arms and shoulders. Petroleum cannot possibly
be in a hurry to arrive anywhere. We can always order that
and many other things time enough before we want it. So
the carriage of everything which does not spoil by keeping
may most wholesomely and safely be done by water-traction
and sailing vessels, and no healthier work nor better discipline
can men be put to than such active porterage.</p>

<p>2. In employing all the muscular power at our disposal, we
are to make the employments we choose as educational as possible.
For a wholesome human employment is the first and
best method of education, mental as well as bodily. A man
taught to plough, row or steer well, and a woman taught to
cook properly and make dress neatly, are already educated in
many essential moral habits. Labor considered as a discipline
has hitherto been thought of only for criminals; but the real
and noblest function of labor is to prevent crime, and not to
be <i>Re</i>formatory but Formatory.</p>

<p>3. The third great principle of employment is, that whenever
there is pressure of poverty to be met, all enforced occupation
should be directed to the production of useful articles
only, that is to say, of food, of simple clothing, of lodging, or
of the means of conveying, distributing, and preserving these.
It is yet little understood by economists, and not at all by the
public, that the employment of persons in a useless business
cannot relieve ultimate distress. The money given to employ
riband-makers at Coventry is merely so much money withdrawn
from what would have employed lace-makers at Honiton,
or makers of something else, as useless, elsewhere. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<i>must</i> spend our money in some way, at some time, and it cannot
at any time be spent without employing somebody. If
we gamble it away, the person who wins it must spend it; if
we lose it in a railroad speculation, it has gone into some one
else's pockets, or merely gone to pay navvies for making a useless
embankment, instead of to pay riband or button makers
for making useless ribands or buttons; we cannot lose it
(unless by actually destroying it) without giving employment
of some kind, and therefore, whatever quantity of money
exists, the relative quantity of employment must some day
came out of it; but the distress of the nation signifies that the
employments given have produced nothing that will support
its existence. Men cannot live on ribands, or buttons, or velvet,
or by going quickly from place to place; and every coin
spent in useless ornament, or useless motion, is so much withdrawn
from the national means of life. Whereas every coin
spent in cultivating ground, in repairing lodgings, in making
necessary and good roads, in preventing danger by sea or land,
and in carriage of food or fuel where they are required, is so
much absolute and direct gain to the whole nation. To cultivate
land round Coventry makes living easier at Honiton,
and every house well built in Edinburgh makes lodgings
cheaper in Glasgow and London.</p>

<p>4th, and lastly. Since for every idle person some one else
must be working somewhere to provide him with clothes and
food, and doing therefore double the quantity of work that
would be enough for his own needs, it is only a matter of pure
justice to compel the idle person to work for his maintenance
himself. The conscription has been used in many countries
to take away laborers who supported their families from their
useful work, and maintain them for purposes chiefly of military
display at public expense. Since this had been long
endured by the most civilized nations, let it not be thought
that they would not much more gladly endure a conscription
which should seize only the vicious and idle already living by
criminal procedures at the public expense, and which should
discipline and educate them to labor, which would not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
maintain themselves, but be serviceable to the commonwealth.
The question is simply this: we must feed the drunkard,
vagabond, and thief. But shall we do so by letting them rob
us of their food, and do no work for it; or shall we give them
their food in appointed quantity, and enforce their doing work
which shall be worth it, and which, in process of time, will
redeem their own characters, and make them happy and serviceable
members of society?<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The different classes of work for which bodies of men
could be consistently organized might ultimately become
numerous; these following divisions of occupation may at once
be suggested.</p>

<p>1. Road-making.&mdash;Good roads to be made wherever
needed, and kept in constant repair; and the annual loss on
unfrequented roads in spoiled horses, strained wheels, and
time, done away with.</p>

<p>2. Bringing in of Waste Land.&mdash;All wastelands not necessary
for public health, to be made accessible and gradually reclaimed.</p>

<p>3. Harbor-Making.&mdash;The deficiencies of safe or convenient
harborage in our smaller ports to be remedied; other harbors
built at dangerous points of coast, and a disciplined body of
men always kept in connection with the pilot and lifeboat services.
There is room for every order of intelligence in this
work, and for a large body of superior officers.</p>

<p>4. Porterage.&mdash;All heavy goods not requiring speed in
transit, to be carried (under preventive duty on transit by railroad)
by canal boats, employing men for draught, and the
merchant shipping service extended by sea; so that no ships
may be wrecked for want of hands, while there are idle ones
in mischief on shore.</p>

<p>5. Repair of Buildings.&mdash;A body of men in various trades
to be kept at the disposal of the authorities in every large
town for consistent repair of buildings, especially the houses
of the poorer orders, who, if no such provision were made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
could not employ workmen on their own houses, but would
simply live with rent walls and roofs.</p>

<p>6. Dress-making.&mdash;Substantial dress, of standard material
and kind, strong shoes, and stout bedding, to be manufactured
for the poor, so as to render it unnecessary for them, unless
by extremity of improvidence, to wear cast clothes, or be without
sufficiency of clothing.</p>

<p>7. Works of Art.&mdash;Schools to be established on thoroughly
sound principles of manufacture and use of materials, and with
simple and, for given periods, unalterable modes of work;
first in pottery, and embracing gradually metal work, sculpture,
and decorative painting; the two points insisted upon,
in distinction from ordinary commercial establishments, being
perfectness of material to the utmost attainable degree; and
the production of everything by hand-work, for the special
purpose of developing personal power and skill in the workman.</p>

<p>The two last departments, and some subordinate branches
of the others, would include the service of women and children.</p>

<p>If you care to give your class a word directly from me,
say to them that they will find it well, throughout life, never
to trouble themselves about what they ought <i>not</i> to do, but
about what they <i>ought</i> to do. The condemnation given from
the judgment throne&mdash;most solemnly described&mdash;is all for
the <i>undones</i> and not for the <i>dones</i>.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> People are perpetually
afraid of doing wrong; but unless they are doing its reverse
energetically, they do it all day long, and the degree does
not matter. The Commandments are necessarily negative,
because a new set of positive ones would be needed for every
person: while the negatives are constant.</p>

<p>But Christ sums them all into two rigorous positions, and
the first position for young people is active and attentive
kindness to animals, supposing themselves set by God to feed
His real sheep and ravens before the time comes for doing
either figuratively. There is scarcely any conception left of
the character which animals and birds might have if kindly
treated in a wild state.</p>

<p>Make your young hearers resolve to be honest in their
work in this life.&mdash;Heaven will take care of them for the other.</p>

yours&mdash;a fireman's duty in fire of hell; and I would fain help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>you in all I could, but my way of going at the thing would be
from the top down&mdash;putting the fire out with the sun, not
with vain sprinklings. People would say I wasn't practical,
as usual of course; but it seems to me the last thing one
should do in the business is to play Lord Angelo, and set
bar and door to deluge. Not but I should sift the windows
of our Oxford printsellers, if I had my full way in my
Art Professorship; but I can't say the tenth part of what I
would. I'm in the very gist and main effort of quite other
work, and can't get my mind turned to this rightly, for this,
in the heart of it, involves&mdash;well, to say the whole range of
moral philosophy, is nothing; this, in the heart of it, one
can't touch unless one knew the moral philosophy of angels
also, and what that means, "but are as the angels in heaven."
For indeed there is no true conqueror of Lust but Love; and
in this beautifully scientific day of the British nation, in
which you have no God to love any more, but only an omnipotent
coagulation of copulation: in which you have no Law
nor King to love any more, but only a competition and a
constitution, and the oil of anointing for king and priest used
to grease your iron wheels down hill: when you have no
country to love any more, but "patriotism is nationally
what selfishness is individually,"<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> such the eternally-damned
modern view of the matter&mdash;the moral syphilis of the entire
national blood: and, finally, when you have no true bride and
groom to love each other any more, but a girl looking out for
a carriage and a man for a position, what have you left on
earth to take pleasure in, except theft and adultery?</p>

<p>The two great vices play into each other's hands. Ill-got
money is always finally spent on the harlot. Look at
Hogarth's two 'prentices; the sum of social wisdom is in that
bit of rude art-work, if one reads it solemnly.</p>

<p>Hence, if from any place in earth, I ought to be able to
send you some words of warning to English youths, for the
ruin of this mighty city was all in one word&mdash;fornication.
Fools who think they can write history will tell you it was
"the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope," and the like!
Alas it was indeed the covering of every hope she had, in God
and his Law.</p>

<p>For indeed, my dear friend, I doubt if you can fight this
evil by mere heroism and common-sense. Not many men are
heroes; not many are rich in common-sense. They will train
for a boat-race; will they for the race of life? For the applause
of the pretty girls in blue on the banks; yes. But to
win the soul and body of a noble woman for their own forever,
will they? Not as things are going, I think, though
how or where they are to go or end is to me at present inconceivable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You think, perhaps, I could help you therefore with a
lecture on good taste and Titian? No, not at all; I might
with one on politics, but that everybody would say was none
of my business. Yet to understand the real meaning of the
word "Sire," with respect to the rider as well as the horse, is
indeed the basis of all knowledge, in policy, chivalry, and
social order.</p>

<p>All that you have advised and exposed is wisely said and
bravely told; but no advice, no exposure, will be of use, until
the right relation exists again between the father and the
mother and their son. To deserve his confidence, to keep it
as the chief treasure committed in trust to them by God: to
be the father his strength, the mother his sanctification, and
both his chosen refuge, through all weakness, evil, danger, and
amazement of his young life. My friend, while you still teach
in Oxford the "philosophy," forsooth, of that poor cretinous
wretch, Stuart Mill, and are endeavoring to open other
"careers" to English women than that of the Wife and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>

intended for separate publication; and to explain that in a subsequent but
unpublished letter Mr. Ruskin explained it to refer to Mill's utter deficiency
in the powers of the imagination.&mdash;The last words of this letter will be
made clearer by noting that the pamphlet dealt with physical, as well as
mental, diet.</p></div></div>




<h3 style="margin-left: 18em;"><span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i>11th February</i>.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">My dear</span>&mdash;&mdash;: I would say much more, if I thought any
one would believe me, of the especial calamity of this time,
with respect to the discipline of youth&mdash;in having no food any
more to offer to their imagination. Military distinction is no
more possible by prowess, and the young soldier thinks of the
hurdle-race as one of the lists and the field&mdash;but the noble
temper will not train for that trial with equal joy. Clerical
eminence&mdash;the bishopric or popular pastorship&mdash;may be tempting
to men of genial pride or sensitive conceit: but the fierce
blood that would have burned into a patriarch, or lashed itself
into a saint&mdash;what "career" has your modern philosophy to
offer to <i>it</i>?</p>

<p>The entire cessation of all employment for the faculty,
which, in the best men of former ages, was continually exercised
and satisfied in the realization of the presence of Christ
with the hosts of Heaven, leaves the part of the brain which
it employed absolutely vacant, and ready to suck in, with the
avidity of vacuum, whatever pleasantness may be presented to
the natural sight in the gas-lighted beauty of pantomimic and
casino Paradise.</p>

<p>All these disadvantages, you will say, are inevitable, and
need not be dwelt upon. In my own school of St. George I
mean to avoid them by simply making the study of Christianity
a true piece of intellectual work; my boys shall at least
know what their fathers believed, before they make up their
own wise minds to disbelieve it. They shall be infidels, if they
choose, at thirty; but only students, and very modest ones, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
fifteen. But I shall at least ask of modern science so much
help as shall enable me to begin to teach them at that age the
physical laws relating to their own bodies, openly, thoroughly,
and with awe; and of modern civilization, I shall ask so much
help as may enable me to teach them what is indeed right, and
what wrong, for the citizen of a state of noble humanity to do,
and permit to be done, by others, unaccused.</p>

<p>And if you can found two such chairs in Oxford&mdash;one, of
the Science of Physical Health; the other, of the Law of
Human Honor&mdash;you need not trim your Horace, nor forbid
us our chatty afternoon tea.</p>

<p>I could say ever so much more, of course, if there were
only time, or if it would be of any use&mdash;about the mis-appliance
of the imagination. But really, the essential thing is the
founding of real schools of instruction for both boys and girls&mdash;first,
in domestic medicine and all that it means; and
secondly, in the plain moral law of all humanity: "Thou shalt
not commit adultery," with all that <i>it</i> means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear</span>&mdash;&mdash;: Two words more, and an end. I have just
re-read the paper throughout. There are two omissions which
seem to me to need serious notice.</p>

<p>The first, that the entire code of counsel which you have
drawn up, as that which a father should give his son, must be
founded on the assumption that, at the proper time of life, the
youth will be able, no less than eager, to marry. You ought
certainly to point out, incidentally, what in my St. George's
work I am teaching primarily, that unless this first economical
condition of human society be secured, all props and plasters
of its morality will be in vain.</p>

<p>And in the second place, you have spoken too exclusively
of Lust, as if <i>it</i> were the normal condition of sexual feeling,
and the only one properly to be called sexual. But the great
relation of the sexes is Love, not Lust; that is the relation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
which "male and female created He them;" putting into
them, indeed, to be distinctly restrained to the office of fruitfulness,
the brutal passion of Lust: but giving them the
spiritual power of Love, that each spirit might be greater and
purer by its bond to another associate spirit, in this world, and
that which is to come; help-mates, and sharers of each other's
joy forever.</p>

<h3 style="margin-left: 18em;"><span class="smcap">Malham</span>, <i>July 3d</i>, 1878.</h3>


<p>Dear&mdash;&mdash;: I wish I were able to add a few more words,
with energy and clearness, to my former letters, respecting a
subject of which my best strength&mdash;though in great part lately
given to it, has not yet enforced the moment&mdash;the function,
namely, of the arts of music and dancing as leaders and governors
of the bodily, and instinctive mental, passions. No
nation will ever bring up its youth to be at once refined and
pure, till its masters have learned the <i>use</i> of all the arts, and
primarily of these; till they again recognize the gulf that
separates the Doric and Lydian modes, and perceive the great
ordinance of Nature, that the pleasures which, rightly ordered,
exalt, discipline, and guide the hearts of men, if abandoned to
a reckless and popular Dis-order, as surely degrade, scatter, and
deceive alike the passions and intellect.</p>

<p>I observe in the journals of yesterday, announcement that
the masters of many of our chief schools are at last desirous of
making the elements of Greek art one of the branches of their
code of instruction: but that they imagine such elements may
be learned from plaster casts of elegant limbs and delicate
noses.</p>

<p>They will find that Greek art can only be learned from
Greek law, and from the religion which gives law of life to all
the nations of the earth. Let our youth once more learn the
meaning of the words "music," "chorus," and "hymn" practically;
and with the understanding that all such practice, from
lowest to highest, is, if rightly done, always in the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and to the praise of God; and we shall have gone far to shield
them in a noble peace and glorious safety from the darkest
questions and the foulest sins that have perplexed and consumed
the youth of past generations for the last four hundred
years.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard the charity children sing in St. Paul's?
Suppose we sometimes allowed God the honor of seeing our
<i>noble</i> children collected in like manner to sing to Him, what
think you might be the effect of such a festival&mdash;even if only
held once a year&mdash;on the national manners and hearts?</p>

<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>October 20th</i>, 1862.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>: I am much obliged by your letter: pardon
me if for brevity's sake I answer with appearance of dogmatism.
You will see the subject treated as fully as I am able
in the course of the papers on political economy, of which the
two first have already appeared in Fraser's Magazine.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>The man and woman are meant by God to be perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>noble and beautiful in each other's eyes. The dress is right
which makes them so. The best dress is that which is beautiful
in the eyes of noble and wise persons.</p>

<p>Right dress is therefore that which is fit for the station in
life, and the work to be done in it; and which is otherwise
graceful&mdash;becoming&mdash;lasting&mdash;healthful&mdash;and easy; on occasion,
splendid; <i>always</i> as beautiful as possible.</p>

<p>Right dress is therefore strong&mdash;simple&mdash;radiantly clean&mdash;carefully
put on&mdash;carefully kept.</p>

<p>Cheap dress, bought for cheapness sake, and costly dress
bought for costliness sake, are <i>both</i> abominations. Right dress
is bought <i>for</i> its worth, and <i>at</i> its worth; and bought only
when wanted.</p>

<p>Beautiful dress is chiefly beautiful in color&mdash;in harmony
of parts&mdash;and in mode of putting on and wearing. Rightness
of mind is in nothing more shown than in the mode of wearing
simple dress.</p>

<p>Ornamentation involving design, such as embroidery, etc.,
produced <i>solely</i> by industry of <i>hand</i>, is highly desirable in the
state dresses of all classes, down to the lowest peasantry.</p>

<p>National costume, wisely adopted and consistently worn, is
not only desirable but necessary in right national organization.
Obeying fashion is a great folly, and a greater crime; but
gradual changes in dress properly accompany a healthful
national development.</p>

<p>The Scriptural authority for dress is centralized by Proverbs
xxxi. 21, 22; and by 1 Samuel i. 24; the latter especially
indicating the duty of the king or governor of the state; as
the former the duty of the housewife. It is necessary for the
complete understanding of those passages, that the reader
should know that "scarlet" means intense central radiance of
pure color; it is the type of purest color&mdash;between pale and
dark&mdash;between sad and gay. It was therefore used with
hyssop as a type of purification. There are many stronger
passages, such as Psalm xlv. 13, 14; but as some people read
them under the impression of their being figurative, I need
not refer to them. The passages in the Prophecies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Epistles against dress apply only to its abuses. Dress worn
for the sake of vanity, or coveted in jealousy, is as evil as anything
else similarly so abused. A woman should earnestly
desire to be beautiful, as she should desire to be intelligent;
her dress should be as studied as her words; but if the one
is worn or the other spoken in vanity or insolence, both are
equally criminal.</p>

<p>I have not time, and there is no need, to refer you to the
scattered notices of dress in my books: the most important is
rather near the beginning of my Political Economy of Art;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
but I have not the book by me: if you make any use of this
letter (you may make any you please), I should like you to
add that passage to it, as it refers to the more immediate need
of economy in dress, when the modes of its manufacture are
irregular, and cause distress to the operative.</p>

<i>SAD-COLORED COSTUMES.</i><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Denmark Hill</span>, S.E., <i>14th Oct.</i>, 1870.</h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "Macmillan's Magazine."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: At p. 423 of your current number, Mr. Stopford A.
Brooke states that it is a proposal of mine for regenerating the
country, that the poor should be "dressed all in one sad-colored
costume."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>It is, indeed, too probable that one sad-colored costume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>may soon be "your only wear," instead of the present motley&mdash;for
both poor and rich. But the attainment of this monotony
was never a proposition of mine; and as I am well aware Mr.
Brooke would not have been guilty of misrepresentation, if he
had had time to read the books he was speaking of, I am sure
he will concur in my request that you would print in full the
passages to which he imagined himself to be referring.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 25.5em;"><span class="smcap">John Ruskin</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>1. "You ladies like to lead the fashion: by all means lead it.
Lead it thoroughly. Lead it far enough. Dress yourselves
nicely, and dress everybody else nicely. Lead the fashions for
the poor first; make <i>them</i> look well, and you yourselves will look&mdash;in
ways of which you have at present no conception&mdash;all the
better."&mdash;<i>Crown of Wild Olive</i> (1866), p. 18.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>2. "In the simplest and clearest definition of it, economy,
whether public or private, means the wise management of labor;
and it means this mainly in three senses: namely, first, applying
your labor rationally; secondly, preserving its produce carefully;
lastly, distributing its produce seasonably.</p>

<p>"I say first, applying your labor rationally; that is, so as to
obtain the most precious things you can, and the most lasting
things by it: not growing oats in land where you can grow
wheat, nor putting fine embroidery on a stuff that will not wear.
Secondly, preserving its produce carefully; that is to say, laying
up your wheat wisely in storehouses for the time of famine, and
keeping your embroidery watchfully from the moth; and lastly,
distributing its produce seasonably; that is to say, being able
to carry your corn at once to the place where the people are
hungry, and your embroideries to the place where they are gay;
so fulfilling in all ways the wise man's description, whether of
the queenly housewife or queenly nation: 'She riseth while it is
yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion
to her maidens. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry, her
clothing is silk and purple. Strength and honor are in her
clothing, and she shall rejoice in time to come.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now you will observe that in this description of the perfect
economist, or mistress of a household, there is a studied expression
of the balanced division of her care between the two great
objects of utility and splendor: in her right hand, food and flax,
for life and clothing; in her left hand, the purple and the
needlework, for honor and for beauty.... And in private and
household economy you may always judge of its perfectness by
its fair balance between the use and the pleasure of its possessions:
you will see the wise cottager's garden trimly divided
between its well-set vegetables and its fragrant flowers: you will
see the good housewife taking pride in her pretty tablecloth and
her glittering shelves, no less than in her well-dressed dish and
full store-room: the care will alternate with gayety; and though
you will reverence her in her seriousness, you will know her best
by her smile."&mdash;"Political Economy of Art" (1857), pp. 10-13.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<i>OAK SILKWORMS.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Times."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In your excellent article of October 17, on possible
substitutes for cotton, you say "it is very doubtful whether
we could introduce the silkworm with profit." The silkworm
of the mulberry tree, indeed, requires a warmer climate than
ours, but has attention yet been directed to the silkworm of
the oak? A day or two ago a physician of European reputation,
Dr. L. A. Gosse, was speaking to me of the experiments
recently made in France in its acclimatization. He stated to
me that the only real difficulty was temporary&mdash;namely, in
the importation of the eggs, which are prematurely hatched as
they are brought through warm latitudes. A few only have
reached Europe, and their multiplication is slow, but once let
them be obtained in quantity and the stripping of an oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
coppice is both robe and revenue. The silk is stronger than
that of the mulberry tree, and the stuff woven of it more
healthy than cotton stuffs for the wearer; it also wears twice
as long. This is Dr. Gosse's report&mdash;likely to be a trust-worthy
one&mdash;at all events, it seems to me worth sending you.</p>

<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The World."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I am very grateful for the attention and candor with
which you have noticed my effort to introduce a new method
of publishing.</p>

<p>Will you allow me to explain one or two points in which
I am generally misunderstood? I meant to have asked your
leave to do so at some length, but have been entirely busy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and can only say, respecting two of your questions, what in
my own mind are the answers.</p>

<p>I. "How many authors are strong enough to do without
advertisements?"</p>

<p>None: while advertisement is the practice. But let it
become the fashion to announce books once for all in a
monthly circular (publisher's, for instance), and the public
will simply refer to that for all they want to know. Such
advertisement I use now, and always would.</p>

<p>II. "Why has he determined to be his own publisher?"</p>

<p>I wish entirely to resist the practice of writing for money
early in life. I think an author's business requires as much
training as a musician's, and that, as soon as he can write really
well, there would always, for a man of worth and sense, be
found capital enough to enable him to be able to print, say, a
hundred pages of his careful work; which, if the public were
pleased with, they would soon enable him to print more. I
do not think young men should rush into print, nor old ones
modify their books to please publishers.</p>

<p>III. And it seems to me, considering that the existing
excellent books in the world would&mdash;if they were heaped
together in great towns&mdash;overtop their cathedrals, that at <i>any</i>
age a man should think long before he invites his neighbors to
listen to <i>his</i> sayings on any subject whatever.</p>

<p>What I do, therefore, is done only in the conviction, foolish,
egotistic, whatever you like to call it, but firm, that I am
writing what is needful and useful for my fellow-creatures;
that if it is so, they will in due time discover it, and that
before due time I do not want it discovered. And it seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>me that no sound scholar or true well-wisher to the people
about him would write in any other temper. I mean to be
paid for my work, if it is worth payment. Not otherwise.
And it seems to me my mode of publication is the proper
method of ascertaining that fact. I had much more to say,
but have no more time, and am, sir, very respectfully yours,</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_150_150" id="Footnote_150_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_150_150"><span class="label">[150]</span></a> This letter refers to an article on Mr. Ruskin's peculiar method of publication
which appeared in the <i>World</i> of May 26, 1875. It was entitled
"Ruskin to the Rescue," and with the criticism to which Mr. Ruskin
alludes, strongly approved the idea of some reform being attempted in the
matter of the publication of books. Mr. Ruskin began the still-continued
method of publishing his works in 1871; and the following advertisement,
inserted in the earlier copies of the first book thus published&mdash;"Sesame
and Lilies"&mdash;will give the reader further information on the matter.
</p>
<p>
"It has long been in my mind to make some small beginning of
resistance to the existing system of irregular discount in the bookselling
trade&mdash;not in hostility to booksellers, but, as I think they will find eventually,
with a just regard to their interest, as well as to that of authors. Every
volume of this series of my collected works will be sold to the trade without
any discount or allowance on quantity, at such a fixed price as will allow
both author and publisher a moderate profit on each volume. It will be sold
to the trade only; who can then fix such further profit on it as they deem
fitting, for retail.
</p>
<p>
"Every volume will be clearly printed, and thoroughly well bound: on
such conditions the price to the public, allowing full profit to the retailer,
may sometimes reach, but ought never to exceed, half a guinea, nor do I
wish it to be less. I will fully state my reasons for this procedure in the
June number of <i>Fors Clavigera</i>.
</p>
<p>
"The price of this first volume to the trade is seven shillings."
</p>
<p>
In subsequent similar notices, some parts of this plan, especially as
regarded purchasers and price, were altered; the trade not accepting the
offer of sale to them only, and the "trouble and difficulty of revising text
and preparing plates" proving much greater than Mr. Ruskin had expected.</p></div></div>

<i>A MISTAKEN REVIEW.</i><a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The excellent letters and notes which have recently
appeared in your columns on the subject of reviewing lead me
to think that you will give me space for the statement of one
or two things which I believe it is right the public should
know respecting the review which appeared in the <i>Examiner</i>
of the 2d of this month (but which I did not see till yesterday),
by Mr. W. B. Scott, of Mr. St. J. Tyrrwhitt's "Letters
on Landscape Art."</p>

<p>1. Mr. Scott is one of the rather numerous class of artists
of whose works I have never taken any public notice, and who
attribute my silence to my inherent stupidity of disposition.</p>

<p>2. Mr. Scott is also one of the more limited and peculiarly
unfortunate class of artists who suppose themselves to have
great native genius, dislike being told to learn perspective, and
prefer the first volume of "Modern Painters," which praises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
many third-rate painters, and teaches none, to the following
volumes, which praise none but good painters, and sometimes
admit the weakness of advising bad ones.</p>

<p>3. My first acquaintance with Mr. Scott was at the house
of a gentleman whose interior walls he was decorating with
historic frescos, and whose patronage I (rightly or wrongly)
imagined at that time to be of importance to him. I was then
more good-natured and less conscientious than I am now, and
my host and hostess attached weight to my opinions. I said
all the good I truly could of the frescos, and no harm;
painted a corn-cockle on the walls myself, in reverent subordination
to them; got out of the house as soon afterwards as
I could, and never since sought Mr. Scott's acquaintance
further (though, to my regret, he was once photographed in
the same plate with Mr. Rosetti and me). Mr. Scott is an
honest man, and naturally thinks me a hypocrite and turncoat
as well as a fool.</p>

<p>4. The honestest man in writing a review is apt sometimes
to give obscure statements of facts which ought to have been
clearly stated to make the review entirely fair. Permit me to
state in very few words those which I think the review in
question does not clearly represent. My "Elements of Drawing"
were out of print, and sometimes asked for; I wished to
rewrite them, but had no time, and knew that my friend and
pupil, Mr. Tyrrwhitt, was better acquainted than I myself
with some processes of water-color sketching, and was perfectly
acquainted with and heartily acceptant of the principles which
I have taught to be essential in all art. I knew he could
write, and I therefore asked him to write, a book of his own
to take the place of the "Elements," and authorized him to
make arrangements with my former publisher for my wood-blocks,
mostly drawn on the wood by myself.</p>

<p>The book is his own, not mine, else it would have been
published as mine, not his. I have not read it all, and do not
answer for it all. But when I wrote the "Elements" I believed
conscientiously that book of mine to be the best then
attainable by the public on the subject of elementary drawing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
I think Mr. Tyrrwhitt's a better book, know it to be a more
interesting one, and believe it to be, in like manner, the best
now attainable by the British public on elementary practice of
art.</p>

<i>THE POSITION OF CRITICS.</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I see you are writing of criticism;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> some of your
readers may, perhaps, be interested in hearing the notions of
a man who has dabbled in it a good many years. I believe, in
a word, that criticism is as impertinent in the world as it is in
a drawing-room. In a kindly and well-bred company, if anybody
tries to please them, they try to be pleased; if anybody
tries to astonish them, they have the courtesy to be astonished;
if people become tiresome, they ask somebody else to play, or
sing, or what not, but they don't criticise. For the rest, a bad
critic is probably the most mischievous person in the world
(Swift's Goddess of Criticism in the "Tale of a Tub" seems
what need be represented on that subject<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>), and a good one
the most helpless and unhappy: the more he knows, the less
he is trusted, and it is too likely he may become morose in his
unacknowledged power. A good executant, in any art, gives
pleasure to multitudes, and breathes an atmosphere of praise,
but a strong critic is every man's adversary&mdash;men feel that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>knows their foibles, and cannot conceive that he knows more.
His praise, to be acceptable, must be always unqualified; his
equity is an offence instead of a virtue; and the art of correction,
which he has learned so laboriously, only fills his hearers
with disgust.</p>

<h3>[From "The Critic," October 27, 1860.]<br />

<i>COVENTRY PATMORE'S "FAITHFUL FOR EVER."</i></h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Critic."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I do not doubt, from what I have observed of the
general tone of the criticisms in your columns, that, in candor
and courtesy, you will allow me to enter protest, bearing such
worth as private opinion may, against the estimate expressed
in your last number of the merits of Mr. C. Patmore's new
poem.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> It seems to me that you have read it hastily; and
that you have taken such view of it as on a first reading
almost every reader of good but impatient judgment would be
but too apt to concur with you in adopting&mdash;one, nevertheless,
which, if you examine the poem with care, you will, I think,
both for your readers' sake and Mr. Patmore's, regret having
expressed so decidedly.</p>

<p>The poem is, to the best of my perception and belief, a
singularly perfect piece of art; containing, as all good art
does, many very curious shortcomings (to appearance), and
places of rest, or of dead color, or of intended harshness,
which, if they are seen or quoted without the parts of the
piece to which they relate, are of course absurd enough, precisely
as the discords in a fine piece of music would be if you
played them without their resolutions. You have quoted
separately Mr. Patmore's discords; you might by the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
system of examination have made Mozart or Mendelssohn
appear to be no musicians, as you have probably convinced
your quick readers that Mr. Patmore is no poet.</p>

<p>I will not beg of you so much space as would be necessary
to analyze the poem, but I hope you will let me&mdash;once for all&mdash;protest
against the method of criticism which assumes that
entire familiarity and simplicity in certain portions of a great
work destroy its dignity. Simple things ought to be simply
said, and truly poetical diction is nothing more nor less than
right diction; the incident being itself poetical or not, according
to its relations and the feelings which it is intended to
manifest&mdash;not according to its own nature merely. To take a
single instance out of Homer bearing on that same simple
household work which you are so shocked at Mr. Patmore's
taking notice of, Homer describes the business of a family
washing, when it comes into his poem, in the most accurate
terms he can find. "They took the clothes in their hands;
and poured on the clean water; and trod them in trenches
thoroughly, trying who could do it best; and when they had
washed them and got off all the dirt, they spread them out
on the sea-beach, where the sea had blanched the shingle
cleanest."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>These are the terms in which the <i>great</i> poet explains the
matter. The less poet&mdash;or, rather, man of modern wit and
breeding, <i>without</i> superior poetical power&mdash;thus puts the
affair into dignified language:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then emulous the royal robes they lave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The vestures cleansed o'erspread the shelly sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their snowy lustre whitens all the strand.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, to my mind, Homer's language is by far the most poetical
of the two&mdash;is, in fact, the only poetical language possible
in the matter. Whether it was desirable to give any account
of this, or anything else, depends wholly on the relation of
the passage to the rest of the poem, and you could only show
Mr. Patmore's glance into the servant's room to be ridiculous
by proving the mother's mind, which it illustrates, to be ridiculous.
Similarly, if you were to take one of Mr. George Richmond's
perfectest modern portraits, and give a little separate
engraving of a bit of the neck-tie or coat-lappet, you might
easily demonstrate a very prosaic character either in the
riband-end or the button-hole. But the only real question
respecting them is their relation to the face, and the degree
in which they help to express the character of the wearer.
What the real relations of the parts are in the poem in question
only a thoughtful and sensitive reader will discover.
The poem is not meant for a song, or calculated for an hour's
amusement; it is, as I said, to the best of my belief, a finished
and tender work of very noble art. Whatever on this head
may be the final judgment of the public, I am bound, for my
own part, to express my obligation to Mr. Patmore, as one of
my severest models and tutors in use of English, and my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>respect for him as one of the truest and tenderest thinkers
who have ever illustrated the most important, because commonest,
states of noble human life.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

"<i>THE QUEEN OF THE AIR.</i>"</h3>


<p>
<i>To the Editor of "The Asiatic."</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I am obliged and flattered by the tone of your article
on my "Queen of the Air" in your last number, but not at all
by the substance of it; and it so much misinterprets my
attempt in that book that I will ask your leave to correct it in
main points.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The "Queen of the Air" was written to show,
not what could be fancied, but what was felt and meant, in the
myth of Athena. Every British sailor knows, that Neptune is
the god of the sea. He does <i>not</i> know that Athena is the
goddess of the air; I doubt if many of our school-boys know
it&mdash;I doubt even if many of our school-masters know it; and
I believe the evidence of it given in the "Queen of the Air"
to be the first clear and connected approximate proof of it
which has yet been rendered by scientific mythology, properly
so called.</p>

<p>You say, "I have not attempted to explain all mythology."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>I wonder what you would have said of me if I <i>had</i>? I only
know a little piece of it here and there, just as I know a crag
of alp or a bend of river; and even what I know could not be
put into a small octavo volume. Nevertheless, I should have
had another such out by this time on the Apolline Myths, and,
perhaps, one on the Earth-Gods, but for my Oxford work;
and shall at all events have a little more to say on the matter
than I have yet said&mdash;and much need there is&mdash;when all that
has yet been done by "scientific" mythology ends in the assertion
made by your reviewer, that "mythology is useful mainly
as a storehouse for poets, and for literary men in want of some
simile or metaphor to produce a striking effect."</p>

<p>Among the various illustrated works which usually grace
the beginning of the year, has appeared one which, though of
graver and less attractive character than its companions, is
likely to occupy a more permanent place on the library
shelves. We allude to "Illustrations of Scripture, by an
Animal Painter," a work which, whatever its faults or weaknesses,
shows at least a singular power of giving reality and
interest to scenes which are apt to be but feebly, if at all,
brought before the mental vision, in consequence of our
familiarity with the words which describe them. The idea
of the work is itself sufficiently original. The animals are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
throughout principal, and the pathos or moral of the passage
to be illustrated is developed from its apparently subordinate
part in it. Thus the luxury and idolatry of the reign of
Solomon are hinted behind a group of "apes and peacocks;"
the Deluge is subordinate to the dove; and the healing of the
lunatic at Gennesareth to the destruction of the herd of swine.</p>

<p>In general, to approach an object from a new point of
view is to place it in a clearer light, and perhaps the very
strangeness of the treatment in some cases renders the subject
more impressive than it could have been made by any more
regular method of conception. But, at all events, supposing
the studies of the artist to have been chiefly directed to
animals, and her power to lie principally in seizing their
character, she is to be thanked for filling her sketches of the
inferior creatures with so much depth of meaning, and rendering
the delineation even of an ape, or a swallow, suggestive of
the most solemn trains of thought.</p>

<p>As so suggestive, without pretence or formalism, these
drawings deserve a place of peculiar honor in the libraries of
the young, while there are also some qualities in them which
fit them for companionship with more elaborate works of art.
The subject of "Lazarus" is treated with a courage and
tenderness which say much for the painter's imagination, and
more for her heart; and the waste of waters above which
the raven hovers is expressed, though rudely, yet in a way
which tells of many an hour spent in watching the play of
the evening light upon the movement of the wearied sea.
It is true that most of the compositions are weakened by a
very visible contempt, if not ignorance, of the laws which
regulate the harmonies of shade, as well as by a painful
deficiency in the drawing. Still there is a life and sincerity
in them which are among the rarest qualities in art; and one
characteristic, very remarkable in the works of a person
described in the text (we doubt not, much against her will)
as an "accomplished lady"&mdash;we mean the peculiar tendency
to conceptions of fearfulness, or horror, rather than of beauty.
The camel, for instance, might, we should have thought, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
easily, and to many persons much more pleasingly, have illustrated
the meeting of Rebekah with the servant of Abraham,
as the desolation of Rabbah; and the dog might as gracefully
have been brought forward to remind us of the words of the
Syro-Ph&#339;nician woman, as to increase the horror of the death
of Jezebel. There are curious evidences of a similar disposition
in some of the other plates; and while it appears to us
indicative of the strength of a mind of no common order, we
would caution the fair artist against permitting it to appear
too frequently. It renders the series of drawings in some
degree repulsive to many persons, and even by those who can
sympathize with it might sometimes be suspected of having
its root in a sublime kind of affectation.</p>

<p>We have spoken of these studies as drawings. They are,
in fact, as good, being photographic facsimiles of the original
sketches. The text is copious, and useful as an elucidation of
the natural history of Scripture.</p>

<p>
(<i>To the Editor of "The Builder.</i>")<br />
</p>

<p>I do not usually answer objections to my written statements,
otherwise I should waste my life in idle controversy;
but as what I say to the workmen at the Architectural Museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
is necessarily brief, and in its words, though not in its substance,
unconsidered, I will answer, if you will permit me,
any questions or cavils which you may think worthy of admission
into your columns on the subject of these lectures.</p>

<p>I do not know if the Cambridge correspondent, whose
letter you inserted last week, is more zealous for the honor of
Cary, or anxious to detect me in a mistake. If the former,
he will find, if he take the trouble to look at the note in the
264th page of the second volume of the "Stones of Venice,"
that Cary's reputation is not likely to suffer at my hands.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
But the translation in the instance quoted is inadmissible. It
does not matter in the least whence the word "limner" is
derived. I did not know when I found fault with it that it
was a corruption of "illuminator," but I knew perfectly that
it did not in the existing state of the English language <i>mean</i>
"illuminator." No one talks of "limning a missal," or of a
"limned missal." The word is now universally understood as
signifying a painter or draughtsman in the ordinary sense, and
cannot be accepted as a <i>translation</i> of the phrase of which it
is a <i>corruption</i>.</p>

<p>Touching the last clause of the letter, I should have thought
that a master of arts of Cambridge might have had wit enough
to comprehend that characters may be illegible by being far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
off, as well as by being ill-shaped; and that it is not less difficult
to read what is too small to be seen than what is too
strange to be understood. The inscription on the Houses of
Parliament are illegible, not because they are in black letters,
but because, like all the rest of the work on that, I suppose,
the most effeminate and effectless heap of stones ever raised
by man, they are utterly unfit for their position.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">J. Ruskin</span>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_159_159" id="Footnote_159_159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_159_159"><span class="label">[159]</span></a> In his lecture on "the distinction between illumination and painting,"
being the first of a series on Decorative Color delivered at the Architectural
Museum, Cannon Street, Westminster, Mr. Ruskin is reported (<i>Builder</i>,
Nov. 25, 1854) to have said, "The line which is given by Cary, 'which
they of Paris call the limner's skill,' is not properly translated. The word,
which in the original is <i>'alluminare</i>,' does not mean the limner's art, but
the art of the illuminator&mdash;the writer and illuminator of books." In criticism
of this remark, "M. A.," writing to the <i>Builder</i> from Cambridge, defended
Cary's translation by referring to Johnson's dictionary to show that
"limner" was after all corrupted from "enlumineur," <i>i.e.</i>, "a decorator of
books with initial pictures." His letter concluded by remarking upon
another of Mr. Ruskin's statements in the same lecture, namely, that "Black
letter is not really illegible, it is only that we are not accustomed to it....
The fact is, <i>no</i> kind of character is really illegible. If you wish to
see real illegibility, go to the Houses of Parliament and look at the inscriptions
there!"
</p>
<p>
The present letter was written in reply to "M. A.," from whom the
latter portion of it elicited a further letter, together with one from "Vindex,"
in defence of Sir Charles Barry and the Houses of Parliament (see the
<i>Builder</i>, Dec. 16, 1854).</p></div>

language, however painfully, than ten cantos of a translation. But an exception
may be made in favor of Cary's 'Dante.' If no poet ever was liable
to lose more in translation, none was ever so carefully translated; and I
hardly know whether most to admire the rigid fidelity, or the sweet and
solemn harmony, of Cary's verse," etc. See the note to the "Stones of
Venice," at the above-named page.</p></div></div>

<h3><i>NOTES ON A WORD IN SHAKESPEARE.</i><br />

II.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <i>29th Sept.</i>, 1878.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Furnivall</span>: Your kind letter comes to me here, and
I must answer on this paper, for, if that bit of note is really
of any use to you, you must please add this word or two more
in printing, as it wouldn't do to let it be such a mere fret on
the vault of its subject. You say not one man in 150 knows
what the line means: my dear Furnivall, not one man in
15,000, in the 19th century, knows, or ever can know, what
<i>any</i> line&mdash;or any <i>word</i> means, used by a great writer. For
most words stand for things that are seen, or things that are
thought of; and in the 19th century there is certainly not
one man in 15,000 who ever looks at anything, and not one
in 15,000,000 capable of a thought. Take the intelligence
of this word in this line for example&mdash;the root of the whole
matter is, first, that the reader should have seen what he
has often heard of, but probably not seen twice in his life&mdash;"Daybreak."
Next, it is needful he should think what
"break" means in that word&mdash;what is broken, namely, and by
what. That is to say, the cloud of night is Broken up, as a
city is broken up (Jerusalem, when Zedekiah fled), as a school
breaks up, as a constitution, or a ship, is broken up; in every
case with a not inconsiderable change of idea and addition to
the central word. This breaking up is done by the Day,
which breaks&mdash;<i>out</i>, as a man breaks, or bursts <i>out</i>, from his
restraint in a passion; breaks <i>down</i> in tears; or breaks <i>in</i>, as
from heaven to earth&mdash;with a breach in the cloud-wall of it;
or breaks <i>out</i>, with a sense of <i>outward</i>&mdash;as the sun&mdash;out and
out, farther and farther, after rain. Well; next, the thing
that the day breaks up is partly a garment, <i>rent</i>, more than
broken; a <i>mantle</i>, the day itself "in russet mantle clad"&mdash;the
blanket of the dark, <i>torn</i> to be peeped through&mdash;whereon
instantly you get into a whole host of new ideas; <i>fretting</i> as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
a moth <i>frets</i> a garment; unravelling at the edge, afterwards;&mdash;thence
you get into <i>fringe</i>, which is an entirely double
word, meaning partly a thing that guards, and partly a thing
that is worn away on the ground; the French <i>Frange</i> has, I
believe, a reminiscence of &#966;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#969; in it&mdash;our "fringe" runs
partly toward <i>frico</i> and friction&mdash;both are essentially connected
with <i>frango</i>, and the fringe of "breakers" at the shores
of all seas, and the breaking of the ripples and foam all over
them&mdash;but this is wholly different in a northern mind, which
has only seen the sea</p>

<p class="center">Break, break, break, on its <i>cold</i> gray stones,&mdash;
</p>

<p>and a southern, which has seen a hot sea on hot sand break
into lightning of phosphor flame&mdash;half a mile of fire in an
instant&mdash;following in time, like the flash of minute-guns.
Then come the great new ideas of order and time, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I did but tell her she mistook her <i>frets</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowed her hand, etc.,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and so the timely succession of either ball, flower, or dentil, in
architecture: but this, again, going off to a totally different
and still lovely idea, the main one in the word <i>aurifrigium</i>&mdash;which
rooted once in <i>aurifex</i>, went on in Etruscan work,
followed in Florence into a much closer connection with
<i>frigidus</i>&mdash;their style being always in <i>frosted</i> gold (see the
dew on a cabbage-leaf or, better, on a gray lichen, in early
sunshine)&mdash;going back, nobody knows how far, but to the
Temple of the Dew of Athens, and gold of Mycen&aelig;, anyhow;
and in Etruria to the Deluge, I suppose. Well, then, the
notion of the music of morning comes in&mdash;with strings of lyre
(or <i>frets</i> of Katharine's instrument, whatever it was) and stops
of various <i>quills</i>; which gets us into another group beginning
with <i>plectrum</i>, going aside again into <i>plico</i> and <i>plight</i>, and
Milton's</p>

<p class="center">"Play in the plighted clouds"
</p>

<p>(the quills on the fretful porcupine are all thought of, first,
in their piped complexity like rushes, <i>before</i> the standing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
in ill-temper), and so on into the <i>plight</i> of folded drapery, and
round again to our blanket. I think that's enough to sketch
out the compass of the word. Of course the real power of it
in any place depends on the writer's grasp of it, and use of the
facet he wants to cut with.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that whatever Mr. Irving has stated that
I said, I <i>did</i> say. But in personal address to an artist, to
whom one is introduced for the first time, one does not usually
say <i>all</i> that may be in one's mind. And if expressions, limited,
if not even somewhat exaggerated, by courtesy, be afterwards
quoted as a total and carefully-expressed criticism, the
general reader will be&mdash;or may be easily&mdash;much misled. I
did and <i>do</i> much admire Mr. Irving's own acting of Shylock.
But I entirely dissent (and indignantly as well as entirely)
from his general reading and treatment of the play. And I
think that a modern audience will <i>invariably</i> be not only
wrong, but diametrically and with polar accuracy opposite to
the real view of any great author in the moulding of his work.
So far as I could in kindness venture, I expressed my feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
to that effect, in a letter which I wrote to Mr. Irving on
the day after I saw the play; and I should be sincerely obliged
to him, under the existing circumstances, if he would publish
<span class="smcap">the whole</span> of that letter.</p>

from one, are as follows: After witnessing the performance of "The Merchant
of Venice" at the Lyceum Theatre, Mr. Ruskin had some conversation
with Mr. Irving on the subject. In the <i>Theatre</i> of January 1880&mdash;p. 63&mdash;appeared
a paragraph which stated that at the interview named Mr. Ruskin
had declared Mr. Irving's "Shylock" to be "noble, tender, and true," and
it is to that statement that the present letter, which appeared in the March
number of the <i>Theatre</i>, relates. With reference to the letter privately addressed
to Mr. Irving, the <i>Theatre</i> of April (p. 249) had a note to the effect
that Mr. Irving had, for excellent and commendable reasons, preferred it
not being made public. For a full statement of Mr. Ruskin's views of "The
Merchant of Venice," see "Munera Pulveris," p. 102.</p></div></div>

recitations as a means of popular instruction. Usually, I like
better to hear beautiful poetry read quietly than recited with
action. But I felt, in hearing Shelley's "Cloud" recited (I
think it was by Miss Josephine) that I also was "one of the
people," and understood the poem better than ever before,
though I am by way of knowing something about clouds, too.
I also know the "Jackdaw of Rheims" pretty nearly by heart;

wish you and yours a happy New Year, and to assure you of the
great pleasure I had in receiving your poems from you, and of
the continual pleasure I shall have in possessing them. I
deferred writing to you in order that I might tell you how
I liked those which were new to me, but Christmas, and certain
little "pattering pairs of restless shoes" which have somehow or
another got into the house in his train, have hitherto prevented
me from settling myself for a quiet read. In fact, I am terribly
afraid of being quite turned upside down when I do, so as
to lose my own identity, for you have already <i>nearly</i> made me
like babies, and I see an ode further on to another antipathy of
mine&mdash;the only one I have in the kingdom of flowers&mdash;the chrysanthemum.
However, I am sure you will be well pleased if you
can cure me of all <i>dislikes</i>. I should write to you now more
cheerfully, but that I am anxious for the person who, of all I
know, has fewest dislikes and warmest likings&mdash;for Miss Mitford.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<p>I trust she is better, and that she may be spared for many years
to come. I don't know if England has such another warm
heart.</p>

your occasions should at any time bring you to London, and</p>

<p>I found a little difficulty in writing the words on the first
page, wondering whether you would think the "affectionate"
misused or insincere. But I made up my mind at last to write
what I felt; believing that you must be accustomed to people's
getting very seriously and truly attached to you, almost at first
sight, and therefore would believe me.</p>

<p>You asked me, the other evening, some kind questions about
my father. He was an Edinburgh boy, and in answer to some
account by me of the pleasure I had had in hearing you, and the
privilege of knowing you, as also of your exertions in the cause
of the Edinburgh poor, he desires to send you the enclosed, to
be applied by you in such manner as you may think fittest for
the good of his native city. I have added slightly to my father's
trust. I wish I could have done so more largely, but my profession
of fault-finding with the world in general is not a lucrative
one.</p>

upon the following facts. It appeared that a girl, named Matilda Griggs,
had been nearly murdered by her seducer, who, after stabbing her in no less
than thirteen different places, had then left her for dead. She had, however,
still strength enough to crawl into a field close by, and there swooned.
The assistance that she met with in this plight was of a rare kind. Two
calves came up to her, and disposing themselves on either side of her bleeding
body, thus kept her warm and partly sheltered from cold and rain
Temporarily preserved, the girl eventually recovered, and entered into
recognizances, under a sum of forty pounds, to prosecute her murderous
lover. But "she loved much," and, failing to prosecute, forfeited her
recognizances, and was imprisoned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for
her debt. "Pity this poor debtor," wrote the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and in the
next day's issue appeared the above letter, probably not intended for the
publication accorded to it.</p></div></div>

them to observe, that it is precisely when he is in most active general occupation
that he can answer fewest private letters; and this year he proposes to
answer&mdash;none, except those on St. George's business. There will be
enough news of him, for any who care to get them, in the occasional

leave things just at the point when one's work on them has

<p>The Slade Professor has tried for five years to please everybody
in Oxford by lecturing at any time that might be conveniently
subordinate to other dates of study in the University.
He finds he has pleased nobody, and must for the future at least
make his hour known and consistent. He cannot alter it this
term because people sometimes come from a distance and have
settled their plans by the hours announced in the <i>Gazette</i>, but
for many he reasons he thinks it right to change the place, and
will hereafter lecture in the theatre of the museum.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> On Friday

time. Afterwards, all his lectures will be at twelve in this and
future terms. He feels that if he cannot be granted so much as
twelve hours of serious audience in working time during the
whole Oxford year, he need not in future prepare public lectures
at which his pupils need not much regret their non-attendance.</p>

you a letter to be read at the first meeting, guarding you

for one; and I am exceedingly glad to receive your present
letter. Mine was not written because it gave me trouble to
think of it, and I can't take trouble now. But without thinking,
I can at once assure you that the taking of the name of

You see it is the heraldic sign on my books, so that you might
still keep pretty close to me.</p>

would be a good name, following out the teaching of the Utopia
as it is taken up in 'Fors.' I can't write more to-day, but I
dare say something else may come into my head, and I'll write
again, or you can send me more names for choice."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_176_176" id="Footnote_176_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_176_176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> A facsimile of this letter, from a collection of autographs in the possession
of Mr. T. F. Dillon Croker, appeared in the above-named issue of the
<i>Autographic Mirror</i>. The subject of the letter will be made clearer by the
following passages from Mr. Ruskin's reminiscence of Mr. William Henry
Harrison, published in the <i>University Magazine</i> of April, 1878, under the
title of "My First Editor."&mdash;"<i>1st February</i>, 1878. In seven days more I
shall be fifty-nine; which (practically) is all the same as sixty; but being
asked by the wife of my dear old friend, W. H. Harrison, to say a few
words of our old relations together, I find myself, in spite of all these years,
a boy again&mdash;partly in the mere thought of, and renewed sympathy with,
the cheerful heart of my old literary master, and partly in instinctive terror
lest, wherever he is in celestial circles, he should catch me writing bad
grammar, or putting wrong stops, and should set the table turning, or the
like.... Not a book of mine, for good thirty years, but went, every word
of it, under his careful eyes twice over&mdash;often also the last revises left to
his tender mercy altogether on condition he wouldn't bother me any more."&mdash;The
book to which the letter refers may be the "Stones of Venice," and
the plate sent the third ("Noble and Ignoble Grotesque"), in the last volume
of that work; and if this be so, the letter was probably written from Herne
Hill about 1852-3.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: Yes, I began writing something&mdash;a year ago,
is it?&mdash;on your subject, but have lost it, and am now utterly
too busy to touch so difficult and so important a subject. I shall
come on it, some day, necessarily.</p>

<p>Meantime, the one thing I have to say mainly is that the
idea of making money by a theatre, and making it educational
at the same time, is <i>utterly</i> to be got out of people's heads.
You don't make money out of a Ship of the Line, nor should
you out of a Church, nor should you out of a College, nor
should you out of a Theatre.</p>

<p>Pay your Ship's officers, your Church officers, your College
tutors, and your Stage tutors, what will honorably maintain
them. Let there be no starring on the Stage boards, more than
on the deck, but the <i>Broadside</i> well delivered.</p>

<p>And let the English Gentleman consider with himself what
<i>he</i> has got to teach the people: perhaps then, he may tell the
English Actor what <i>he</i> has to teach them.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: I am heartily glad you think my letter may
be of some use. I wish it had contained the tenth part of what
I wanted to say.</p>

<p>May I ask you at least to add this note to it, to tell how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
indignant I was, a few days ago, to see the drop-<i>scene</i>(!) of the
<i>Folies</i> at Paris composed of huge advertisements! The ghastly
want of sense of beauty, and endurance of loathsomeness gaining
hourly on the people!</p>

<p>They were playing the <i>Fille du Tambour Major</i> superbly,
for the most part; they gave the introductory convent scene
without the least caricature, the Abbess being played by a very
beautiful and gracefully-mannered actress, and the whole thing
would have been delightful had the mere decorations of the
theatre been clean and pretty. To think that all the strength
of the world combining in Paris to amuse itself can't have clean
box-curtains! or a pretty landscape sketch for a drop scene!&mdash;but
sits in squalor and dismalness, with bills stuck all over its
<i>rideau</i>!</p>

<p>I saw <i>Le Chalet</i> here last night, in many respects well played
and sung, and it is a quite charming little opera in its story,
only it requires an actress of extreme refinement for the main
part, and everybody last night sang too loud. There is no
music of any high quality in it, but the piece is one which,
played with such delicacy as almost any clever, <i>well-bred</i> girl
could put into the heroine's part (if the audiences would look
for acting more than voice), <i>ought</i> to be extremely delightful to
simple persons.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I heard <i>William Tell</i> entirely massacred
at the great opera-house at Paris. My belief is they scarcely
sang a piece of pure Rossini all night, but had fitted in modern
skimble-skamble tunes, and quite unspeakably clumsy and common
<i>ballet</i>. I scarcely came away in better humor from the
mouthed tediousness of <i>Gerin</i> at the <i>Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, but they took
pains with it, and I suppose it pleased a certain class of audience.
The <i>William Tell</i> could please nobody at heart.</p>

<p>The libretto of <i>Jean de Nivelle</i> is very beautiful, and ought
to have new music written for it. Anything so helplessly tuneless
as its present music I never heard, except mosquitoes and
cicadas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: I am greatly flattered by your letter, but
there are two reasons why I can't stand&mdash;the first, that though I
believe myself the stanchest Conservative in the British Islands,
I hold some opinions, and must soon clearly utter them, concerning
both lands and rents, which I fear the Conservative
Club would be very far from sanctioning, and think Mr. Bright
himself had been their safer choice. The second, that I am not
in the least disposed myself to stand in any contest where it is
possible that Mr. Bright might beat me.</p>

<p>Are there really no Scottish gentlemen of birth and learning
from whom you could choose a Rector worthier than Mr. Bright?
and better able than any Southron to rectify what might be
oblique, or hold straight what wasn't yet so, in a Scottish University?</p>

<p>Might I ask the favor of the transmission of a copy of this
letter to the Independent Club? It will save me the difficulty
of repetition in other terms.&mdash;And believe me, my dear sir,

<h2>EPILOGUE.</h2>


<p>I find my immitigable Editor insists on epilogue as well
as prologue from his submissive Author; which would have
fretted me a little, since the last letter of the series appears to
me a very pretty and comprehensive sum of the matters in
the book, had not the day on which, as Fors would have it, I
am to write its last line, brought to my mind something of
importance which I forgot to say in the preface; nor will it
perhaps be right to leave wholly without explanation the short
closing letter to which I have just referred.</p>

<p>It should be observed that it was written to the President
of the <i>Liberal</i> party of the Glasgow students, in answer to the
question which I felt to be wholly irrelevant to the business
in hand, and which could not have been answered in anything
like official terms with anything short of a forenoon's work. I
gave the answer, therefore, in my own terms, not in the least
petulant, but chosen to convey as much information as I could
in the smallest compass; and carrying it accurately faceted
and polished on the angles.</p>

<p>For instance, I never, under any conditions of provocation
or haste, would have said that I hated Liberalism as I did
<i>Mammon</i>, or Belial, or Moloch. I chose the milder fiend of
Ekron, as the true exponent and patron of Liberty, the God
of Flies; and if my Editor, in final kindness, can refer the
reader to the comparison of the House-fly and House-dog, in
(he, and not I, must say where)<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> the letter will have received
all the illustration which I am minded to give it. I was only
surprised that after its publication, of course never intended,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>though never forbidden by me, it passed with so little challenge,
and was, on the whole, understood as it was meant.</p>

<p>The more important matter I have to note in closing, is
the security given to the conclusions arrived at in many subjects
treated of in these letters, in consequence of the breadth
of the basis on which the reasoning is founded. The multiplicity
of subject, and opposite directions of investigation,
which have so often been alleged against me, as if sources of
weakness, are in reality, as the multiplied buttresses of the
apse of Amiens, as secure in allied result as they are opposed
in direction. Whatever (for instance) I have urged in economy
has ten times the force when it is remembered to have
been pleaded for by a man loving the splendor, and advising
the luxury of ages which overlaid their towers with gold, and
their walls with ivory. No man, oftener than I, has had cast
in his teeth the favorite adage of the insolent and the feeble&mdash;"ne
sutor." But it has always been forgotten by the speakers
that, although the proverb might on some occasions be wisely
spoken by an artist to a cobbler, it could never be wisely
spoken by a cobbler to an artist.</p>
